You may want to consider using 2 dor 3 different videos for each task, For example 2 different wrestling videos instead of 4 or 5 of the same. At times, the grader already know what to expect for each scene, thus some video damages may not be as annoyingng because he/she already know what's coming up next in the video and isn't missing any part of the scene in theory.
