Quality damage definitely damages watching experience. Especially at times of crucial point of a match, if there is quality damage either by low resolution or pause, it creates a lot of frustration. In the videos which were shown the quality damage were of low resolution. The quality damage due to low resolution at critical points of the match definitely are really frustrating for a viewer. At some points of the match, these issues would not affect much, but at some turning points of the match, these quality damages of the video are really frustrating.
