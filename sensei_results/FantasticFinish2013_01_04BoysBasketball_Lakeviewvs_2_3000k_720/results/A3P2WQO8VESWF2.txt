In my opinion I feel that in quality damages, video pause of 1 second is more tolerable than decrease in resolution. But in crucial time periods of the game especially when attempting to put the ball into basket by the players and while passing the ball, the quality damage of video pause is annoying. The experiment guidelines and grading are not at all confusing.
