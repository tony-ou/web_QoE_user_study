Momentary decrease in resolution is hardly a problem, but anything over a couple of seconds is very annoying and always has me wondering if it's the original video or my connection. Similarly, anything beyond the tiniest pause can ruin a video for me, as I find pausing very distracting and concerning. The experiment seemed very clear to me and I had no issues with it. Thank you!
