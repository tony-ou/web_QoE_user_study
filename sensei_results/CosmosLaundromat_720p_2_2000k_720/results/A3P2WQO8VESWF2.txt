In the video clips shown quality damage is caused by video pause alone. But I think it is not much affecting the watching experience as far as this video is concerned. Since it is only a slight pause, only in certain moments like when the caterpillar arises, it is causeing some annoyance in watching experience. Otherwise it is tolerable. The experiment guide lines and attention checks and grading guidelines were not confusing.
