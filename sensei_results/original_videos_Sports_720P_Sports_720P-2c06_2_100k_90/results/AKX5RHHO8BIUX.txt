Bad resolution and/or stops at the beginning of the video makes me believe the whole video will be this way and decreases my interest.  Damage during the run of the video makes me impatient and upset, while damage at the very end doesn't affect me as much.  It's very hard to determine the boundaries between the various grade levels; what I might perceive as 'fair' you might see as 'poor', so I tried to err on the conservative side.
