In the video clips which were shown, the main issue is video pause and there is no quality damage due to decrease in resolution. But at crucial points, for example when Bunny falls into the spears, when video pause occurs, it is the most annoying viewing experience. At other points it is quite tolerable. I also personally feel that quality damage due to video pause is little bit more tolerable than decrease in resolution. It also depends on the time extent ot the pause. The experiment guide lines and grading was clear.
