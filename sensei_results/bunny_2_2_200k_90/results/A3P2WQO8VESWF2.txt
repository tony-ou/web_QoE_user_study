In the video clips shown in this case there were both types of quality damage, i.e. both video pause and decrease in resolution. Those which occur at not so important time points of the movie are tolerable, where as those which occur at most exciting time points of the video are quite annoying. For example at the moment when Bunny launches near the spears, the quality damage is very much affecting the viewing experience. The experiment guide lines and grading are quite easy and clear.
