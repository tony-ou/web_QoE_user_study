The resolution issues were very impactful once the person jumped, resulting in not being able to track him or read the subtitles.  The delay was worse when he was about to jump.  Overall these were bad because the whole point is to be able to track his progress and if you can't see him, you can't do that. The resolution issues were more impactful than the pauses overall
