These clips have quality damage of decrease in resolution. In my opinion, I feel that those decrease in resolution happening at the begining of the video is much more disturbing than those which are happening afterwards. If the quality damage occurs at the time or before the person jumps in the video it is liitle more affecting the watching experience. The experiment guidelines, grading and attention checks were easy to understand.
