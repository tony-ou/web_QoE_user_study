If the impairment is near the beginning then it doesn't feel frustrating or affect the viewing experience. However, if it is towards the middle, then it feels frustrating, because that is where most of the action happens, which is when the frisbee is thrown and starts to land. It is annoying because if I enjoyed this sport, then I would want to be able to clearly watch where the frisbee has landed, not view a blurred video of it happening.
