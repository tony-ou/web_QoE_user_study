#REASONING#
###########

A1UM7U8DA3RMA9: Watching videos with low resolution and pause issue will be annoying and disturbing, that too at the time of playing some exciting moments.  Experiment guidelines are clear.
AJZBAP861F6X1: video got paused and blur, very annoying
A8FUMDQFBKMXR: Pauses and decrease in quality during winning shot are upsetting
A2BO8M77CS3SGZ: Poor quality at important times are very annoying to watch.
A31Z5TPD8QKE26: both the stalling and blurry damage happening at the same time is always frustrating.  When it happens during the last seconds of game play, it's always worse than at other less important moments.
A1IU5OP7BBZHZ7: resolution decrease occurs a very fraction of second , or it is cameras effect is a confusion
A38NFX88VZDMJ3: If the pause wasn't in the middle of the game
A122E99M2DQY1G: resolution decrease and video pause
A3PGUPNMOU5BPW: These were fairly annoying. I guess at the end it didn't matter as much because it was just footage of the hoop and referee. 
A70L26UXLTGLC: It's just intuitive on feelings between good and fair here. When there is a pause in more animation movement it's more annoying.
A30YUELTPFSF0T: Really it was a fantastic finish, But video resolution decreasing as well as it was paused. it was really disturbing while watching.
A3169N2SCN3ENK: The quality makes me lose focus on what I am watching and it takes away from my concentration.  The experiment guideline is clear.  I am not confused about the grading.
A6DX45U3O1CR: found both resolution decrease and video pause for more than one second
A1NJ6Q940T7HEB: Found both resolution decrease and video pause
A272A0JGRTBFCR: Thanks for your â€‹OUTSTANDING HITS and i would thank you for giving me the chance to participate and you are helping make me better.
A3OLRWACCCCUTU: The experience was impacted mostly by when the resolution issue occured, with it being worse when it was while the players and ball were traveling.  The freezing had less negative impact.
A3UM3RQRAL4DP5: both video pausing and video resolution decrease
A3QZMGTVA4VO44: Quality damage in the starting as well as after the ball shoot is made, it is not making any difference at all. But damage during the game affects my experience. The guidelines are very clear and nothing is confusing about the grading.
A1NH9LK567B862: The video quality damaged at each and every video. It just blurred and paused for a second. The experiment guide is so clear which helps in grading the videos without any confusions.
A1IHI23KH87K5W: Low level blur for short time is not a problem, whenever it occurs. Pausing is different, totally depends on context.
A2YHSU2IJZ9J14: More grading examples will be helpful.
A2QD9PJUKW7PKK: ranking i had given based on the video resolution.there was also 2 sec paused in video but resolution was not good but not low in some videos. experiment guideline is clear. No confusion regarding grading or the attention check
A3O7X46E3REM7I: It makes the viewing experience annoying. Everything was clear.
A3P2WQO8VESWF2: Video quality damages of both decrease in resolution and video pause are seen in these videos. They are most disturbing at certain time periods of the video, like when attempting to put the ball into the basket and during the passing of the ball by the players near the goal post etc. At other situations they can be tolerated eventhough they affect the viewing experience. The experiment guide lines and attention checks were easy to understand.
A1S34BUFNQ33SQ: All the videos paused and blurred, Some of the videos while throwing the ball to Basketball net got blurred and paused, In couple of videos while giving the pass to other person it got paused, which is effecting the video
A11SX02CICZN85: It just affect my eagerness to watch the clip. The guidelines for this HIT is very clear as always. I haven't confused in grading
A3QS7M912JGKFD: video pause and resolution decreased
A4T7PYGN1BE2P: Guideline is clear.. and it is  annoying when video get paused and  quality decreased
ASWZO1WY1UHEP: Attention check was clear and also instruction was clear. I can clearly find the damage or quality of the video. Video quality was very poor. I feel little bit disturbance to watch the video based on the quality. All videos, resolution was decreased and paused more than 1 second. 
AVPD36WUJKJFS: Video getting pause for a second or resolution getting low will be irritating thing, mainly when we are watching some live sports; this experiment guideline is clear and not confused.
