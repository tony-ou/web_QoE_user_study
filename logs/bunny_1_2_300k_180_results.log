#REASONING#
###########

A320BT7PLIQVZT: Durung the action times it was more annoying. and when the resolution dropped quality after the pause.
A2H8GNSEVUJXYL: slow enough paced it doesn't matter
AJZBAP861F6X1: Very interesting Survey. Video got paused is affects the video watching experience.
A2SKH7WZUEDGGI: not confused
A3PYEW6693PCHT: the pausing in the middle of the scene is annoying because it interrupts the movie. Right before something is happening is the worst time for the quality of the video to occur.
A3SKQPPOKCZU88: Annoying resolution and pausing of video and distraction to eyes
A8FUMDQFBKMXR: Pauses right when the trap hits the bunny is annoying
A3N5RTXKN4I723: resolution decrease and video pause for more than 1 second
ASPRULQHB8B1F: The resolution was decreasing a lot, so the image wasn't sharp as it should be, especially for an animated 3D movie
A31Z5TPD8QKE26: Since there was always action in the video, every time it stalled and got blurry, I though they were all equally bad.
A1IU5OP7BBZHZ7: got struck in between videos makes loose patience, Blurring for very few seconds makes no difference from the good one
A38NFX88VZDMJ3: If the pause was too long or during an event.
A122E99M2DQY1G: resolution decrease and video pause
A3PGUPNMOU5BPW: These all had stops and blurs but I didn't find them to be that annoying. They seemed short and not that damaging.
A1NOINYD1FZ55T: During the videos found blurry and paused some seconds.Not confusing.I grade easy to all videos.
A70L26UXLTGLC: It's just intuitive on feelings between good and fair here. When there is a pause in more animation movement it's more annoying.
A2J237J8KM3OCS: its a matter of action going with timestamps, sometime its annoying and sometime its enhance of your viewing experience 
A22VLXXVIEJSD1: When the log is about to strike the character and it pauses is very annoying. 
A30YUELTPFSF0T: Video Quality was damaged by the pause, It was also reduce the Resolution Quality. Looks cute animation on the video quality was affected.
A3OLRWACCCCUTU: When a delay happened is important, if it's during some critical action, like the animal being hit, I rated it lower.  How long the delay and how long the resolution lasted, and when it happened early vs. late mattered as well.
A1IHI23KH87K5W: How annoying the pause is depends on when it occurs. If a character is speaking for instance, that might be really  annoying, but we would need sound added to test that ;)
AJY6J33X1KJNP: Pauses had more of an impact than a slight distortion. Pauses at a point where there was clear motion and heightened anticipation (the log falling, or the vine breaking) were most annoying. I believe the instructions were clear, and I think I followed them correctly.
A2YHSU2IJZ9J14: More grading examples will be helpful.
A2QD9PJUKW7PKK: ranking i had given based on the video resolution and there was 2 sec paused in every video. experiment guideline is clear
A3N5P5VO81FIJ6: a little
AAKL8L5X64LWD: Pauses during character movement were more jarring.
A3P2WQO8VESWF2: The quality damage which occurs due to video pause and decrease in resolution is most felt at important points of time in the clip for example when the arrow is shot and when Bunny and his friends was going to be hit by the swing, is most annoying. At the other portions it is tolerable, eventhough it depends on the extent of quality damage and the period for which it occurs. The experiment guidelines and attention checks were quite easy and clear.
A1S34BUFNQ33SQ: I have noticed both blurs and pauses in all the videos. Couple of the videos really making me annoying because during that time in those video's main action is going on, which is very important for those videos  
A1USDMJVT10CE4: if the resolution or pausing occurs during moments of action.
A11SX02CICZN85: It just affect my eagerness to watch the clip. The guidelines for this HIT is very clear as always. I haven't confused in grading
A4T7PYGN1BE2P: Guideline is clear and it is annoying when video quality decreased and video get paused.
ASWZO1WY1UHEP: Attention check was clear and also instruction was clear. I can clearly find the damage or quality of the video. Video quality was very poor. All videos, resolution was decreased and paused more than 1 second. Overall I like this cartoon video.
