#REASONING#
###########

A2H8GNSEVUJXYL: with hd video the blurring is even more dramatic
A1UM7U8DA3RMA9: Watching videos with low resolution and pause issue will be annoying and disturbing , Experiment guidelines is clear.
AJZBAP861F6X1: very annoying quality damage in test series.
A8FUMDQFBKMXR: Pauses and quality decrease during the most important part of the match are extremely annoying
A1L8RL58MYU4NC: The Quality damages blur and slag annoyed me a lot no one will like this kind of annoying clips. The Guidelines for this experiment is very clear. Attention check and grading doesn't confused me
A3N5RTXKN4I723: resolution decrease and video pause for more than 1 second
A2BO8M77CS3SGZ: Poor quality at important times are very annoying to watch.
ASPRULQHB8B1F: Sometimes we don't know if the game is pausing or if the video stoped playing. It is really frustrating
A31Z5TPD8QKE26: When the blurry damage and stalling was during the screen transition, I didn't think it was as bad as when it happens during a goal shot.
A38NFX88VZDMJ3: When the poor quality broke up the video too much
A122E99M2DQY1G: resolution decrease and video pause
A3PGUPNMOU5BPW: 6 is a little less annoying than the rest because of the natural pause I think. It was clear.
A30YUELTPFSF0T: Video Paused and Resolution decrease which damages the quality. It was considered as an Bad
A3169N2SCN3ENK: The quality makes me lose focus on what I am watching and it takes away from my concentration.  The experiment guideline is clear.  I am not confused about the grading.
A6DX45U3O1CR: found both resolution decrease and video pause for more than one second
A3B67I3A0YR2D: found both bad resolution and video pause
AH22ILXQFI4R2: resolution decrease and video pause for more than 1 second.
A272A0JGRTBFCR: Thanks for your â€‹OUTSTANDING HITS and i would thank you for giving me the chance to participate and you are helping make me better.
A3OLRWACCCCUTU: The worst was the delay and blur during peak action, it made it seem like things were wrong longer than they probably were.  When it cut to the logo and that was delayed that wasnt a big deal.  When there are resolution issues during action that keeps you from seeing what's going on clearly that's a bad experience in general.
A1N62PWMUOG2YY: Since this involves a soccer video game, it feels like every second is crucial. Each second that the game is paused or the quality is bad, it feels like I am missing out on the action of the game. For example, when the ball is kicked but there is no one near the ball and the game play freezes, it is annoying because I want to know what happens next. When the quality is blurry, then I am annoyed because I cannot clearly see the movements of the individual players.
A3UM3RQRAL4DP5: both video pausing and video resolution decrease
A1NH9LK567B862: The video quality damaged at each and every video. It just blurred and paused for a second. The experiment guide is so clear which helps in grading the videos without any confusions.
A1IHI23KH87K5W: Much like watching the real football clips, it's annoying when the pause and/or blur occurs at crucial moment of game. During logo transition or replay it's much less annoying.
A2YHSU2IJZ9J14: More video examples will be helpful.
A2QD9PJUKW7PKK: ranking i had given based on the video resolution and 2 sec paused in every video
A2MCG5W6LHSRG9: if the damage happened turning the transition from regular play to replay it was the best time. During the shot was the worst.
A3O7X46E3REM7I: It makes the viewing experience annoying. Everything was clear.
A3P2WQO8VESWF2: These video clips have both video pause and decrease in resolution damages. Those occuring at moments of the match near the goal post when a goal is expected is most annoying and disturbing. The extent and time period of the damage affects the watching experience. The experiment guide lines and grading instructions are quite clear.
A1S34BUFNQ33SQ: As per my observation, All of the videos blur and paused, Couple of the video's not even visible properly goal kick, Which is really annoying to see those videos 
A11SX02CICZN85: It just affect my eagerness to watch the clip. The guidelines for this HIT is very clear as always. I haven't confused in grading
A3QS7M912JGKFD: video paused and resolution got decreased, guideline is very clear
ASWZO1WY1UHEP: Attention check was clear and also instruction was clear. I can clearly find the damage or quality of the video. Video quality was poor. All videos, resolution was decreased and paused more than 1 second. 
AVPD36WUJKJFS: Video getting pause for a second or more will be irritating thing, mainly when we are watching some live sports; this experiment guideline is clear and not confused.
