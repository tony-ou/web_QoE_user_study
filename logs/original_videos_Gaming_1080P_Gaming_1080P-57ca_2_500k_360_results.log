#REASONING#
###########

A2H8GNSEVUJXYL: it looked like one of the pauses was at a prearranged pause anyway so it didn't matter
A1UM7U8DA3RMA9: Watching videos with frequent low resolution and pause issue will be annoying and disturbing thing  . Experiment guidelines are clear.
AJZBAP861F6X1: very annoying quality damage in test series.
A3PYEW6693PCHT: The random pauses are annoying, especially during a game. It interrupts the flow of the game. Guidelines are very clear and I was not confused about anything.
A1L8RL58MYU4NC: The Quality damages blur and slag annoyed me a lot no one will like this kind of annoying clips. The Guidelines for this experiment is very clear. Attention check and grading doesn't confused me
A3N5RTXKN4I723: resolution decrease and video pause for more than 1 second
A2BO8M77CS3SGZ: Poor quality at important times are very annoying to watch. However if the quality is poor at times when the game is not in play then its fine. The guidelines for the study is pretty clear.The study is interesting.
A21D966T20TNKX: SUDDEN CHANGING OF QUALITY DISTURBS THE IMAGE AND IT IS NOT QUITE GOOD FOR A WATCHING EXPERIENCE
A31Z5TPD8QKE26: the stalling and blurry picture was more annoying when it was during an action filled time like a goal shot.
A1IU5OP7BBZHZ7: not getting interested when it got blurred
A38NFX88VZDMJ3: If the pause didn't stop the game too much
A122E99M2DQY1G: resolution decrease and video pause
A3PGUPNMOU5BPW: The one at the start was more annoying. The screen that changes almost seems like a pause. Everything was clear.
A1NOINYD1FZ55T: During the videos found blurry and paused some seconds.Not confusing.I grade easy to all videos.
A2J237J8KM3OCS: its a matter of action going with timestamps, sometime its annoying and sometime its enhance of your viewing experience 
A30YUELTPFSF0T: Video paused and resolution was occurred, Overall it is poor
A3169N2SCN3ENK: The quality makes me lose focus on what I am watching and it takes away from my concentration.  The experiment guideline is clear.  I am not confused about the grading.
A6DX45U3O1CR: found both resolution decrease and video pause for more than one second
A3B67I3A0YR2D: found both bad resolution and video pause
AH22ILXQFI4R2: resolution decrease and video pause for more than 1 second.
A1NJ6Q940T7HEB: Found both resolution decrease and video pause
A3AA5G6HENO6VJ: when it is stopping in pausing section so I change little quality
A272A0JGRTBFCR: Thanks for your ​OUTSTANDING HITS and i would thank you for giving me the chance to participate and you are helping make me better.
A3OLRWACCCCUTU: The worst is when it freezes while the resolution is off, particularly if it's in the middle of intense action.  A freeze or brief issue with resolution when nothing is really fast moving isn't as much of an issue to the experience.
A3UM3RQRAL4DP5: both video pausing and video resolution decrease
A1NH9LK567B862: The video quality damaged at each and every video. It just blurred and paused for a second. The experiment guide is so clear which helps in grading the videos without any confusions.
A18LFH7XW61JO9: Quality damage at the crucial time affect the viewing experience a lot. Like, when the match is intense and full attention is diverted to the match, quality decrease is annoying at that time. Grading and attention check is clear. Although pause is in every video but measuring that it is more than one second or not is difficult.
A1IHI23KH87K5W: These videos had both blurring and pauses, at different times. The only thing I would say is that I find really harsh blurring very, very annoying. I would rather have a pause or less harsh blurring over a longer time period.
AJY6J33X1KJNP: The resolution damage did not affect me as much. However, the pauses were really annoying, because it interrupted the flow of the game - especially if they occurred right after a ball was kicked. The guidelines seemed clear, and I think I did everything correctly.
A2YHSU2IJZ9J14: More grading examples will be helpful.
A2QD9PJUKW7PKK: ranking i had given based on the video resolution and 2 sec paused in every video
A3P2WQO8VESWF2: The quality damages occuring at moments when it seems that a goal is going to be scored are most frustrating. At some other points the watching experience does not suffer much. The experiment guidelines and attention checks are clear.
A1S34BUFNQ33SQ: I found pauses and blurs in all the videos. But in some videos the pauses/blurs occur before the kick to the goal court, which is annoying to see 
A11SX02CICZN85: It just affect my eagerness to watch the clip. The guidelines for this HIT is very clear as always. I haven't confused in grading
A1TXOZQU1O4F0N: All video is of the standard Bad Reference video. So the quality I mentioned is all about video quality.
A4T7PYGN1BE2P: Guideline is clear and it is annoying when video quality decreased and video get paused.
ASWZO1WY1UHEP: Attention check was clear and also instruction was clear. I can clearly find the damage or quality of the video. Video quality was poor. All videos, resolution was decreased and paused more than 1 second. 
AVPD36WUJKJFS: Video getting pause for a second or resolution getting low will be irritating thing, mainly when we are watching some live sports; this experiment guideline is clear and not confused.
