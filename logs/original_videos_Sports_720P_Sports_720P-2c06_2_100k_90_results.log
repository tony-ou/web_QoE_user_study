#REASONING#
###########

A2H8GNSEVUJXYL: bad resolution occurs in the middle of the athletes endeavors is not a good thing
AKX5RHHO8BIUX: Bad resolution and/or stops at the beginning of the video makes me believe the whole video will be this way and decreases my interest.  Damage during the run of the video makes me impatient and upset, while damage at the very end doesn't affect me as much.  It's very hard to determine the boundaries between the various grade levels; what I might perceive as 'fair' you might see as 'poor', so I tried to err on the conservative side. 
A3UUH3632AI3ZX: it's annoying to be watching a video that has sudden pauses and poor video quality unless it's at the very end of the clip
AJZBAP861F6X1: Very interesting Survey. Video got Blur and paused for a minute it affects the video watching experience.
A8FUMDQFBKMXR: during unimportant momments the drop in quality isn't bad but pauses are not acceptable.  
A1L8RL58MYU4NC: The Quality damages blur and slag annoyed me a lot no one will like this kind of annoying clips. The Guidelines for this experiment is very clear. Attention check and grading doesn't confused me
A3N5RTXKN4I723: resolution decrease and video pause for more than 1 second
A2BO8M77CS3SGZ: Poor quality at important times are very annoying to watch. However if the quality is poor at times when the game is not in play then its fine. The guidelines for the study is pretty clear.
ASPRULQHB8B1F: Both the resolution and the flow of the videos were very poor, making them unbereable to watch
A31Z5TPD8QKE26: The combination of stalling and blurriness during a critical point in the action made it worse than when the damage was during an unimportant part.
A26UIS59SY4NM6: Worst while he is winding up to throw the discus.
A1IU5OP7BBZHZ7: I cannot concentrate on the video as it got blurred in between
A122E99M2DQY1G: all videos are resolution decrease and video pause more than 1 second, i am understood the guidelines.
A3PGUPNMOU5BPW: 5/7 was probably the least annoying of the bunch. 
A1NOINYD1FZ55T: During the videos found blurry and paused some seconds.Not confusing.I grade easy to all videos.
A70L26UXLTGLC: The pause and blur at the end or during the throw were more annoying then the pause at the very beginning.
A3OOGICWSLXYB0: The blur effect and the pause affects my watching experience a lot. I am not confused about grading.
A3169N2SCN3ENK: The quality makes me lose focus on what I am watching and it takes away from my concentration.  The experiment guideline is clear.  I am not confused about the grading.
A6DX45U3O1CR: found both resolution decrease and video pause for more than one second
A3B67I3A0YR2D: found both bad resolution and video pause
AH22ILXQFI4R2: resolution decrease and video pause for more than 1 second.
ADD5IHZ1P6TLH: When the pause happens at the moment where the important event (the moment the athlete was about to throw) was annoying
A1NJ6Q940T7HEB: Found both resolution decrease and video pause
A272A0JGRTBFCR: Starting Quality ok but in middle and end not good
A3OLRWACCCCUTU: The last one wasn't as bad because the issues were before the action really started, but the combination of the lag and resolution issues were still not good.  The worse was when the issues happenened while the athlete was in motion getting ready to throw.
A1P3Z24Y6GRNVA: If its at the first of the video, i wouldn't continue watching it. The pauses effects the video when its at a critical point, like when the disc lands. It really takes away from the anticipation. 
A3UM3RQRAL4DP5: both video pausing and video resolution decrease
A1NH9LK567B862: The video quality damaged at each and every video. It just blurred and paused for a second. The experiment guide is so clear which helps in grading the videos without any confusions.
A1IHI23KH87K5W: Neither the pause nor blurring very annoying when watching this
A2YHSU2IJZ9J14: More grading examples will be helpful.
A2QD9PJUKW7PKK: ranking i had given based on the video resolution and there is 2 sec paused in every video.
A3O7X46E3REM7I: It makes the viewing experience annoying. Everything was clear.
A3N5P5VO81FIJ6: a little
A3P2WQO8VESWF2: Quality damage annoyance depends on the moment it occurs. In the case of these videos, the crucial moments where the discus throw is attempted and the time when it lands on earth are very crucial points. The quality damages which occur at these periods are the most annoying. The experiment guide lines are clear and no confusion is there about grading or attention checks.
ARTQWWNFA7IOD: In test videos observed extra resolution decrease and extra video pause of more than 1 second compared with excellent grade reference.
A1S34BUFNQ33SQ: I found pauses and blurs in all the videos. But I think in one video the pause occurs right before the player is going to shoot ball which makes more annoying than the other videos.
A11SX02CICZN85: It just affect my eagerness to watch the clip. The guidelines for this HIT is very clear as always. I haven't confused in grading
A3QS7M912JGKFD: video paused and resolution got decreased, guideline is very clear
A4T7PYGN1BE2P: The Guideline are clear and it is annoying when video get paused and quality decreased.
A1Y25W1Y7KDE5: The quality drop is particularly annoying during key moments of the video, when the athlete is preparing to throw the discus, or as the discus is landing. It's not as bad otherwise.
ASWZO1WY1UHEP: Attention checks was clear and instruction was understandable. I can clearly find the damage or quality of the video. Video quality was very bad. Sometimes little bit irritating to watch the video, because of the quality. All videos, resolution was decreased and paused more than 1 second.
AVPD36WUJKJFS: Video getting pause or low resolution will be irritating, and I use to get breaking/throwing things near to me when watching online live streaming of sports; this experiment guideline is clear and not confused about the grading or the attention check. Thank You.
