#REASONING#
###########

A2H8GNSEVUJXYL: stopping the action and lowering the resolution when there are cars on the track is the double whammy
A1UM7U8DA3RMA9: Watching videos with low resolution and pause issue will be annoying and disturbing. Experiment guidelines are clear.
AJZBAP861F6X1: Very annoying, video resolution decreased and also paused
A3SKQPPOKCZU88: In this videos the resolution and pausing of video is too much to watch this video.
A1L8RL58MYU4NC: The Quality damages blur and slag annoyed me a lot no one will like this kind of annoying clips. The Guidelines for this experiment is very clear. Attention check and grading doesn't confused me
A3N5RTXKN4I723: resolution decrease and video pause for more than 1 second
A2BO8M77CS3SGZ: Poor quality at important times are very annoying to watch. The car video was boring to watch.
ASPRULQHB8B1F: When the video stutters it is really annoying, because we feel frustrated without knowing what's going on or what is gonna happen next. I don't think the side-by-side comparison is really necessary, since it is clear that it is a fully working high definiton video
A31Z5TPD8QKE26: I thought it was worse when the cars were doing something exciting and the damage happened.
A26UIS59SY4NM6: The best place for the quality damage was when there were no cars within the camera's range.
A1IU5OP7BBZHZ7: The resolution decrease was somewhat doubtful
A122E99M2DQY1G: resolution decrease and video pause
A1NOINYD1FZ55T: During the videos found blurry and paused some seconds.Not confusing.I grade easy to all videos.
A30YUELTPFSF0T: Video Paused and Resolution decrease which damages the quality. It was considered as Bad
A3169N2SCN3ENK: The quality makes me lose focus on what I am watching and it takes away from my concentration.  The experiment guideline is clear.  I am not confused about the grading.
A6DX45U3O1CR: found both resolution decrease and video pause for more than one second
A3B67I3A0YR2D: found both bad resolution and video pause
AH22ILXQFI4R2: resolution decrease and video pause for more than 1 second.
A1NJ6Q940T7HEB: Found both resolution decrease and video pause
A272A0JGRTBFCR: Thanks for your ​OUTSTANDING HITS and i would thank you for giving me the chance to participate and you are helping make me better.
A3OLRWACCCCUTU: Please note the last video did not display (#8) and I wasn't given the opportunity to rate it either.  When there were cars on screen and there was both a pause and poor resolution that was a worse experience.  If there were no cars it wasn't as noticable. 
A1N62PWMUOG2YY: Since the video is about car and maneuvers, I did not think that the video quality affected the play back of the video. Although most of the test videos included blurriness, I did not think it affected the overall video. It did not aggravate me or make me feel like I was missing much, since I could still see what was going on, although not clearly. When the videos paused, I did not feel annoyed either, because nothing really exciting or time sensitive was going on.
A3UM3RQRAL4DP5: both video pausing and video resolution decrease
A3QZMGTVA4VO44: Quality damage in car racing is highly distracting. It has severe impact on my watching experience. Guidelines are very clear and easily understandable. There is no confusion in grading or attention check.
A18LFH7XW61JO9: Quality damage at the crucial time affect the viewing experience. I mean when a crucial moment arise and the video stops, it is very annoying.
A1IHI23KH87K5W: I gave most of these "Fair" because although the pausing is obviously bad, I thought the blurring was done pretty well and didn't spoil my enjoyment much at all.
A2YHSU2IJZ9J14: You may want o consider using different videos within a task instead of all the same video. At times, video damages are not as annoying because the grader already knows what is coming up for the next scene and therefore the element of missing anything due to the video damage isn't as great.
A2QD9PJUKW7PKK: test video 2 was tricky. video was paused when no car were there in track, but i was counting that after 5 sec car was coming in track but the car should come in 3 sec as per training video. and all videos clarity were poor and 2 sec video was paused
A3P2WQO8VESWF2: In these video clips the quality damage includes both video pause and decrease in resolution. But at some points of time it does not seem to affect the viewing experience much. Especially if it is encountered at the most crucial moments of the video it is quite annoying. The experiment guidelines, grading and attention check instructions were quite clear.
A1S34BUFNQ33SQ: I found all the video's blur and paused, But blurs very slight, Hence I feel it is fair quality wise, Also the video's which were blur & paused all those are in different time frames and which does not impact the video viewing to me
A11SX02CICZN85: It just affect my eagerness to watch the clip. The guidelines for this HIT is very clear as always. I haven't confused in grading
A3QS7M912JGKFD: extra resolution reduced and video paused
A4T7PYGN1BE2P: Guideline is clear and annoying when video get paused and quality decreased.
ASWZO1WY1UHEP: Attention checks was clear and instruction was understandable. I can clearly find the damage or quality of the video. Video quality was slightly poor.  Some cars I can't see clear. All videos, resolution was decreased and paused more than 1 second.
AVPD36WUJKJFS: Video getting pause or low resolution will be irritating, missing a 1 second video on a thrilling moment will break my heart,  this experiment guideline is clear and not confused about the grading or the attention check. Thank You.
