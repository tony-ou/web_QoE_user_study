#REASONING#
###########

A1T79J0XQXDDGC: It is hard to watch soccer with a level of degradation that is seen here.
A1UM7U8DA3RMA9: It is very much annoying when the online streaming video got blurry or struck in-between, And the guidelines are very clear. Thank You.
A3UUH3632AI3ZX: Regardless of when it happened, it was still such horrible quality.
A1Y0ABOUJUMCWW: I have no confution about grading or the attention check
AMKGMVI25PC0B: found both resolution and video pause
A8FUMDQFBKMXR: The quality decrease is too much to make this enjoyable
A1L8RL58MYU4NC: The Quality damages blur and slag annoyed me a lot no one will like this kind of annoying clips. The Guidelines for this experiment is very clear. Attention check and grading doesn't confused me
A3N5RTXKN4I723: resolution decrease and video pause for more than 1 second
A2BO8M77CS3SGZ: Poor quality makes the watching experience annoying.
A1IU5OP7BBZHZ7: disturbed the view when getting paused and blurred
A38NFX88VZDMJ3: When the video was low quality at important points in the game or lasted a couple seconds.
A1F1BIPJR11LSR: If the quality damage happenes during a low action time in the game it is not as impactful if it is at a high point.
A163J5TEJBO43B: It annoyed me most when it happened during a play that could result in a goal or a significant action, but no matter where the decrease happened I found it very annoying. The pause on a graphic wasn't so bad, but the resulting loss in resolution was very bad no matter where it occured.
A122E99M2DQY1G: resolution decrease and video pause
A3PGUPNMOU5BPW: I think these were all very annoying. I think it could be seen that the goal damage video is more annoying. I didn't see it that way though. I felt like these were all pretty damaging. The blurs felt like they lasted a long time.
A1NOINYD1FZ55T: During the videos found blurry and paused some seconds.Not confusing.I grade easy to all videos.
A30YUELTPFSF0T: Video's resolution was affected and it was also pause. Soccer was very game and while with this disturbance was giving frustration. I think i am good with the attention check.
A6DX45U3O1CR: found both resolution decrease and video pause for more than one second
A1NJ6Q940T7HEB: Found both resolution decrease and video pause
A272A0JGRTBFCR: Thanks for your â€‹OUTSTANDING HITS and i would thank you for giving me the chance to participate and you are helping make me better.
A3OLRWACCCCUTU: All of these were bad, particularly the resolution issues which seemed extreme and blocked the ability to see play in action.  The resolution issues were far more impactful than the freezes.
ASDKBXZBSJNZD: I feel like it is more bothersome when the video quality is at the very end or at a crucial point in the game, like when someone is trying to score a goal. I am not confused about anything.
A3G5IPGLH1IIZN: It doesn't matter when it happens, it takes me out of the experience and makes me want to stop watching/move on to something else. It was straightforward and pretty clear. I just didn't know when exactly to pick the gradations, not just the extreme ratings.
A1IHI23KH87K5W: If blurring or pause happens at crucial moment, then obviously very annoying. If during replay or dull moment, less annoying.
A2QD9PJUKW7PKK: after video paused and then video resume the quality of resolution is too low and can't find watchable. So based on this i had given bad rating in last 5 videos.
A3O7X46E3REM7I: It makes the viewing experience annoying. Everything was clear.
A3P2WQO8VESWF2: Quality damage depicted in these videos are both caused due to low resolution and video pause. They both are very annoying and frustrating. Especially based on the occurence of these at crucial events of the match is the determinant of the rate of annoyance. The experiment guidelines are very clear, the experiment quite interesting and there is not at all any confusion regarding grading or attention checks.
A9EVF0SO2IUJ0: Some videos struck at the middle or end with low quality and also pause in between more than 1 sec. Nice instructions.
ARTQWWNFA7IOD: In test video observed poor quality like dim resolution and pause more than 1 sec.
A1S34BUFNQ33SQ: I could see all the video's blur and pauses, But couple of video's were not able to visible the football goal shots, which is really annoying to watch the videos 
A124E03UMDZAA9: It makes it so that I cannot watch the videos due to the loss of quality.  
A4T7PYGN1BE2P: guideline is very clear and it is annoying when video paused and quality reduced.
A320QA9HJFUOZO: If the damage is during an important moment of the video, like a soccer shot, it is more annoying. If it happens during an unimportant moment, it is more forgivable.  The guidelines are clear. The popup saying the videos are loading is annoying and unnecessary. 
A3DZGDF9HCTAOB: The quality damage at different times was very bad. I did not like it when the video clarity was bad at the beginning. Since all the videos had resolution clarity and were paused, they were all very bad to look at. The resolution usually became bad after the pause. The guideline is very clear. I am not confused about the grading or the attention check.
ASWZO1WY1UHEP: Attention check was clear and also instruction was clear. I can clearly find the damage or quality of the video. Video quality was poor. It was worst quality. All videos, resolution was decreased and paused more than 1 second.  Overall I like this gaming video.
AVPD36WUJKJFS: Video getting pause for a second or more will be irritating thing, Mainly when we are watching some live sports, This experiment guideline is clear and not confused about the grading or the attention check.
