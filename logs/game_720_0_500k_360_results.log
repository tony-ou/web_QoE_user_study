#REASONING#
###########

A3GLUDQZGEJL5G: The low quality of the video takes you out of the immersion of the video.
A1UM7U8DA3RMA9: Watching videos with low resolution and pause issue will be annoying thing, mostly occur because of poor internet connection, And I have given grading accordingly. Experiment guideline is clear.
A8FUMDQFBKMXR: the decrease in resolution isn't bad when it's not during the shooting and explosive action
A1L8RL58MYU4NC: The Quality damages blur and slag annoyed me a lot no one will like this kind of annoying clips. The Guidelines for this experiment is very clear. Attention check and grading doesn't confused me
A3N5RTXKN4I723: resolution decrease
A2BO8M77CS3SGZ: Poor quality at important times are very annoying to watch. However in video games it matters less. The guidelines are pretty clear and easy to understand.
A31Z5TPD8QKE26: When the tank was just sitting still with no action, the blurry damage wan't so annoying.
A26UIS59SY4NM6: The pauses are more of a problem when they occur. These videos didn't have it. The time of the disruption didn't really bother me.
A1IU5OP7BBZHZ7: good videos makes us watch interesting. But blurring even for less than a second makes difficult to catch
A38NFX88VZDMJ3: If the low quality was only minor.
A122E99M2DQY1G: resolution decrease
A3PGUPNMOU5BPW: These blurs weren't super noticable or annoying. I thought these were all pretty good videos. It was clear. I'm not confused. Let me know if I am doing anything wrong.
A1R0689JPSQ3OF: I think degredation at the beginning of the video is more noticeable and really negatively affects the experience of watching. During the middle was noticeable but didn't affect the experience as much. Also in this video when the degredation happens right before the zoom in or after the zoom out it didn't affect me as much.
A30YUELTPFSF0T: Video quality affected by Resolution, While watching some particles are coming near the screen was awesome. However it was affected by resolution, it is disturbing the watching. It was not paused
A6DX45U3O1CR: resolution decrease
A3B67I3A0YR2D: Video resolution decrease
AH22ILXQFI4R2: resolution decrease
A3OLRWACCCCUTU: While the resolution was noticable in each, it varied and was barely noticable in some.  If the resolution waivered after a shot was fired, it almost seemed like it was an effect of the blast.
A3UM3RQRAL4DP5: resolution decrease
A1NH9LK567B862: The quality affects when it starts blurred. The guideline is so clear and there is no confusion while grading the video
A1IHI23KH87K5W: That small amount of blur in those videos doesn't affect my enjoyment at all
A2YHSU2IJZ9J14: More grading examples will be helpful.
A2QD9PJUKW7PKK: ranking i had given based on the video resolution. there was no paused in any videos i.e last 5 videos.
A3P2WQO8VESWF2: In the video clips shown, it is seen that the only quality damage is decrease in resolution and that too only very little, which is tolerable and does not affect watching experience very much. The only moment when low resolution causes annoyance is while aiming a target in the game. But in these video clips shown there is not much quality damage and it was rated accordingly. The experiment guidelines and attention checks were clear without any confusion.
ARTQWWNFA7IOD: Noticed video quality at par with excellent grade reference
A1S34BUFNQ33SQ: I found all the video's very minute quality miss compare to excellent peace of video's, Also no pauses found, But overall the video quality is completely good 
A11SX02CICZN85: It just affect my eagerness to watch the clip. The guidelines for this HIT is very clear as always. I haven't confused in grading
AVQGY7FCU80XP: When the visual quality decrease it reduces the enjoyment of the content and makes it hard to see details.
AVPD36WUJKJFS: Video getting pause or low resolution  will be irritating thing, This experiment guideline is clear and not confused about the grading or the attention check. Thank You
