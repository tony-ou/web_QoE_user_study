#REASONING#
###########

A3GLUDQZGEJL5G: The random freezes take you out of the action of the game but the reduced clarity in the video makes it so you can't even follow what's going on. Those two things together in a video are so annoying that you immediately want to turn them off. 
A2H8GNSEVUJXYL: bad video in combat is the difference between life and death
A1UM7U8DA3RMA9: Watching videos with low resolution and pause issue will be annoying thing, mostly occur because of poor internet connection, And I have given grading accordingly. Experiment guideline is clear.
AJZBAP861F6X1: Resolution decrease in all videos, paused, so annoying.
A8FUMDQFBKMXR: significant blur and pausing during a very active scene
A1L8RL58MYU4NC: The Quality damages blur and slag annoyed me a lot no one will like this kind of annoying clips. The Guidelines for this experiment is very clear. Attention check and grading doesn't confused me
A219VCQZADQ45W: BRIEF PAUSE, OR A LITTLE BLURRY CAN BE ANNOYING ESPECIALLY IF IT IS RIGHT BEFORE A GOAL OR JUMPING OFF A CLIFF
A3N5RTXKN4I723: resolution decrease and video pause for more than 1 second
A2BO8M77CS3SGZ: Poor quality at important times are very annoying to watch. However in video games it matters less. The guidelines are pretty clear and easy to understand.
ASPRULQHB8B1F: When watching a game stream we always want to see the game like it really is, full resolution and no pauses. When the video lacks quality, we can't know for sure how the game really runs
A31Z5TPD8QKE26: The screen stalling while completely black was the worst.  It also felt bad when the stalling and blurry picture was during the crucial time of looking through the scope.
A1IU5OP7BBZHZ7: very poor quality in most of the videos
A122E99M2DQY1G: resolution decrease and video pause
A70L26UXLTGLC: All the test videos were bad with both a pause and blur.
A30YUELTPFSF0T: If video was paused, our expectation of the next moment was disturbed. If resolution was affected, it will irritating us while watching the video. In this task both resolution affected and video was paused
A3169N2SCN3ENK: The quality makes me lose focus on what I am watching and it takes away from my concentration.  The experiment guideline is clear.  I am not confused about the grading.
A6DX45U3O1CR: found both resolution decrease and video pause for more than one second
A3B67I3A0YR2D: found both bad resolution and video pause
AH22ILXQFI4R2: resolution decrease and video pause for more than 1 second.
A3OLRWACCCCUTU: These were all really bad from my perspective, but especially the one where the screen went black.  There was a lag and resolution issue at the same time in all of them.  If this were a game I was playing I'd want my money back.
A3UM3RQRAL4DP5: both video pausing and video resolution decrease
A3LMI7ZDFO8JHR: there where alot of frame drops and i wasnt confusing about the attention check
A1NH9LK567B862: The video quality damaged at each and every video. It just blurred and paused for a second. The experiment guide is so clear which helps in grading the videos without any confusions.
A1IHI23KH87K5W: Very bad blur in this set combined with pause does make for an annoying combination.
A2QD9PJUKW7PKK: ranking i had given based on the video resolution. last video after few seconds screen goes black for 2-3 secs. So i had assume that video was paused.
A2MCG5W6LHSRG9: when something novel was happening like the tanks shooting, zooming in or an explosion a video issue was really annoying.
A3P2WQO8VESWF2: These video clips which are gaming clips have both decrease in resolution and video pause quality damages. But those occuring at certain moments like when aiming is going on are very very annoying. Otherwise also if both these quality damages occurs simultaneously it is a bit of concern and negatively affecting watching experience. The experiment guide lines as well as attention checks were clear and there is no confusion at all.
ARTQWWNFA7IOD: Noticed extra resolution decreased and extra video pause when compared with excellent grade reference
A1S34BUFNQ33SQ: I found all the videos blur and paused, I have noticed some of the videos which were blur and paused before and after blast.
A11SX02CICZN85: It just affect my eagerness to watch the clip. The guidelines for this HIT is very clear as always. I haven't confused in grading
A3QS7M912JGKFD: video paused and resolution got decreased, guideline is very clear
A4T7PYGN1BE2P: Guideline is clear. It is annoying when video quality decreased and paused.
A320QA9HJFUOZO: Damage at an important time in the video is more annoying, like right in the middle of action. Everything is clear. Make the HIT timers longer please
AVPD36WUJKJFS: Video getting pause or low resolution will be irritating thing, This experiment guideline is clear and not confused about the grading or the attention check. Thank You.
