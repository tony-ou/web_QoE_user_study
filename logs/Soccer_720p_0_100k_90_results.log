#REASONING#
###########

A3GLUDQZGEJL5G: I think if I had to choose between the damage qualities issues, I would choose to have the pauses rather than the deterioration of the image because with the pauses you don't miss anything. 
A1Y0ABOUJUMCWW: I have no confution about grading or the attention check
AMKGMVI25PC0B: resolution decrease
A8FUMDQFBKMXR: Changes in quality is tolerable as long as they aren't big but I hate pauses to buffer.
A3N5RTXKN4I723: resolution decrease
A2BO8M77CS3SGZ: Some impairments are very annoying as they appear at important timestamps.
A1IU5OP7BBZHZ7: I cannot concentrate on the video as it got blurred 
A38NFX88VZDMJ3: When the low image quality happens at key points in the game or lasts over 2 seconds.
A1F1BIPJR11LSR: If the quality degrades during a replay than it is not as disruptive as if it were doing actual gameplay.
A122E99M2DQY1G: resolution decrease
A3PGUPNMOU5BPW: The blur at the start was the most annoying on this one. 
A1NOINYD1FZ55T: During the videos found blurry some seconds.
A30YUELTPFSF0T: Resolution decrease in the videos are really affecting the video quality. But there was no pause in the Video. However it was very difficult for me select the attention check questions. It was confusing me. I think i have chosen the correct checks.
A3169N2SCN3ENK: The quality makes me lose focus on what I am watching and it takes away from my concentration.  The experiment guideline is clear.  I am not confused about the grading.
A6DX45U3O1CR: resolution decrease
A3B67I3A0YR2D: Video resolution decrease
A1NJ6Q940T7HEB: Found resolution decrease
A272A0JGRTBFCR: Thanks for your â€‹OUTSTANDING HITS and i would thank you for giving me the chance to participate and you are helping make me better.
A3OLRWACCCCUTU: Most of the resolution issues were while the ball was in play which was very negative as you couldn't see the action clearly.  When the ball wasn't in play it was still very fuzzy but not as extremely negative.
ABUNAEPK8GV63: There are more important moments in the video that you would want to see as clearly as possible and when the quality decreases at those moment it is very noticeable. Like when one of the teams attempted to score a goal.
A3QZMGTVA4VO44: Some timestamps make my attention getting diverted. The guidelines are clear and nothing is confusing. Side-by-side comparison is highly helpful in grading. 
A1NH9LK567B862: I get annoyed when the video got blurred deeply. It literally brings a bad experience. The guideline is very clear to understand. It helps me to grade the video without any issues
A1IHI23KH87K5W: If the blurring is very bad, like it was in these videos, it really is very annoying, regardless of when it occurs
AIQ1I6ODSIO56: If the drop in quality didn't happen at an important time, that might make me less inclined to rate it poorly. Or, depending on how much resolution was lost or how long the resolution drop lasted.
A2QD9PJUKW7PKK: ranking i had given based on the video resolution. 
A3O7X46E3REM7I: It makes the viewing experience annoying. Everything was clear.
A3P2WQO8VESWF2: Quality damage definitely damages watching experience. Especially at times of crucial point of a match, if there is quality damage either by low resolution or pause, it creates a lot of frustration. In the videos which were shown the quality damage were of low resolution. The quality damage due to low resolution at critical points of the match definitely are really frustrating for a viewer. At some points of the match, these issues would not affect much, but at some turning points of the match, these quality damages of the video are really frustrating. The guidelines of the experiment were clear and there is not at all any confusion regarding grading or attention check.
ARTQWWNFA7IOD: Noticed extra resolution decrease when compared with excellent grade reference
A1S34BUFNQ33SQ: I could see all the video's blur, But couple of video's were not able to visible the football goal shots, which is really annoying to watch those video's 
A3QS7M912JGKFD: video resolution was decreased, your guideline is very clear
A4T7PYGN1BE2P: guideline is very clear and it is annoying when video quality reduced.
A3DZGDF9HCTAOB: It was irritating when the video quality blurred and the resolution became low towards the time the team was aiming for the goal and towards the end of the match. I became very tense, watching the video. The experiment guideline, grading and the attention checks are very clear.
AVPD36WUJKJFS: Video getting pause for a second or more will be irritating thing, Mainly when we are watching some live sports, This experiment guideline is clear and not confused about the grading or the attention check.Blurry and stall in online Videos will be irritating thing, Mainly when we are watching some live sports, This experiment guideline is clear and not confused about the grading or the attention check. One of my concern is about the HIT timing, its 15 minutes now seems little short, Request to increase HIT timing to 30 minutes. Thank You.
