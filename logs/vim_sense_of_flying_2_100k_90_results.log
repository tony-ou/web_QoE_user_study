#REASONING#

A2H8GNSEVUJXYL: only bad when it happens after he jumps
A1UM7U8DA3RMA9: Watching videos with low resolution and pause issue will be annoying and disturbing. Experiment guidelines are clear.
A3UUH3632AI3ZX: no matter when it happened, that much disturbance was extremely annoying because the video was cool
A1L8RL58MYU4NC: The Quality damages blur and slag annoyed me a lot no one will like this kind of annoying clips. The Guidelines for this experiment is very clear. Attention check and grading doesn't confused me
A3N5RTXKN4I723: resolution decrease and video pause for more than 1 second
A2BO8M77CS3SGZ: It was an exciting video. The quality damage in the video was frustrtaing. Had fun in working on this study.Instruction were clear. Looking forward to work more on these.Thank you
A31Z5TPD8QKE26: the whole video is action, so any stalling and blurry combination really messed with enjoying the flight.  And the captions were throughout the video so being blurry made it impossible to read.  All were equally bad damages.
A1IU5OP7BBZHZ7: got struck in between videos makes loose patience, Blurring for very few seconds makes no difference from the good one
A1F1BIPJR11LSR: If the quality damage happenes during a low action time in the game it is not as impactful if it is at a high point.
A122E99M2DQY1G: resolution decrease and video pause
A1NOINYD1FZ55T: Not confusing. easy to grade all videos. all video clips are blurry and passes one second.
A30YUELTPFSF0T: Video Paused and Resolution decrease which damages the quality. It was considered as an Bad
A3169N2SCN3ENK: The quality damage causes me to lose focus on the video and it is distracting.  The experiment guideline is clear.  I am not confused about grading or the attention check.
A6DX45U3O1CR: found both resolution decrease and video pause for more than one second
A3B67I3A0YR2D:  found both bad resolution and video pause
AH22ILXQFI4R2: resolution decrease and video pause for more than 1 second.
A1NJ6Q940T7HEB: Found both resolution decrease and video pause
A272A0JGRTBFCR:  http://ec2-54-212-225-203.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3012
A3OLRWACCCCUTU: The resolution issues were very impactful once the person jumped, resulting in not being able to track him or read the subtitles.  The delay was worse when he was about to jump.  Overall these were bad because the whole point is to be able to track his progress and if you can't see him, you can't do that. The resolution issues were more impactful than the pauses overall
A3UM3RQRAL4DP5: both video pausing and video resolution decrease
A3QZMGTVA4VO44: Quality damage in the video is highly annoying and distracting. The guidelines are very clear and nothing is confusing about grading or attention check.
A1NH9LK567B862: The video quality damaged at each and every video. It just blurred and paused for a second. The experiment guide is so clear which helps in grading the videos without any confusions.
A1IHI23KH87K5W: Pauses can be quite annoying when watching someone fall out of the sky
A2QD9PJUKW7PKK: ranking i had given based on the video resolution and 2 sec paused in every video. Every video has 3 sec low resolution video and clarity is too low that i can't see anything looks like blur in video.
A3O7X46E3REM7I: It makes the viewing experience annoying. Everything was clear.
A3N5P5VO81FIJ6: pausing the video some times
A3P2WQO8VESWF2: Quality damage at different moments affect watching experience negatively depending on the moment of time frame these damages occur. In the video clips there were quality damages of both video pause and decrease in resolution. In these videos the quality damages were most disturbing when it occured at the start of the clips. When the quality damages occured when the person was starting to jump and actually jumping were more annoying than those which occur afterwards. The experiment guidelines were clear and so is the grading and attention checks.
ARTQWWNFA7IOD: Observed the Quality Damages due to resolution decrease and video pause more than 1second
A1S34BUFNQ33SQ: I found all the video's blur and pauses, But this pause or blurs doesn't effect the performance of video and viewing experience
A11SX02CICZN85: It just affect my eagerness to watch the clip. The guidelines for this HIT is very clear as always. I haven't confused in grading
A3QS7M912JGKFD: video resolution was decreasing and paused some times
ASWZO1WY1UHEP: I can't confuse attention checks and instruction was clear. I can clearly find the damage or quality of the video. Video quality was very bad. I can't read subtitles. All videos resolution was decreased and paused more than 1 second.
AVPD36WUJKJFS: Video getting pause or low resolution will be irritating, missing a 1 second video on a thrilling moment will break my heart, The experiment guideline is clear and not confused about the grading or the attention check. Thank You.
