#REASONING#
###########

A2H8GNSEVUJXYL: basketball is a fast game and you need good video all the time to appreciate it
A1UM7U8DA3RMA9: Watching videos with low resolution and pause issue will be annoying and disturbing , Experiment guidelines is clear.
AJZBAP861F6X1: very annoying quality damage in test series.
A3SKQPPOKCZU88: The quality and video pausing is very high compared to Bad reference videos. 
A8FUMDQFBKMXR: Pauses and quality decrease during the most important part of the match are extremely annoying
A3N5RTXKN4I723: resolution decrease and video pause for more than 1 second
A2BO8M77CS3SGZ: Poor quality at important times are very annoying to watch. However if the quality is poor at times when the game is not in play then its fine. The guidelines for the study is pretty clear.
ASPRULQHB8B1F: When watching a sports event, we always want to have a clear view, which is not the case here, since the resolution drops during important moments. Very upsetting
A31Z5TPD8QKE26: The extreme blurry damage and stalling was equally bad no matter where it was located in the clip.
A1IU5OP7BBZHZ7: It annoys me when it get struck
A1F1BIPJR11LSR: If the quality damage happenes during a low action time in the game it is not as impactful if it is at a high point.
A122E99M2DQY1G: resolution decrease and video pause
A1NOINYD1FZ55T: During the videos found blurry and paused some seconds.Not confusing.I grade easy to all videos.
A30YUELTPFSF0T: Quality of video was affected by both Resolution and Pause. While ball going to the net and it was pause means, It is frustrating and players are enjoying their moment at that resolution was lacking. Game is good
A3169N2SCN3ENK: The quality makes me lose focus on what I am watching and it takes away from my concentration.  The experiment guideline is clear.  I am not confused about the grading.
A6DX45U3O1CR: found both resolution decrease and video pause for more than one second
AH22ILXQFI4R2: resolution decrease and video pause for more than 1 second.
A1NJ6Q940T7HEB: Found both resolution decrease and video pause
A272A0JGRTBFCR: Thanks for your â€‹OUTSTANDING HITS and i would thank you for giving me the chance to participate and you are helping make me better.
A3OLRWACCCCUTU: The resolution issues in particular made this hard to follow.  It was so fast moving and something was constantly happening which the blurring kept me from seeing.
A3UM3RQRAL4DP5: both video pausing and video resolution decrease
A1NH9LK567B862: The video quality damaged at each and every video. It just blurred and paused for a second. The experiment guide is so clear which helps in grading the videos without any confusions.
A18LFH7XW61JO9: When the score was made, it was the most crucial moment. Quality damage at the crucial time affect the viewing experience a lot. Like, when the player was going to throw the ball, pause at that time was annoying. Or when the ball was in air.
A1IHI23KH87K5W: If the blurring is very severe, like it was in this selection, I find that the absolute worst. It's very frustrating, you try to squint to see what is going on ;)
A2YHSU2IJZ9J14: More grading examples will be helpful.
A2QD9PJUKW7PKK: ranking i had given based on the video resolution. there is 3 sec low resolution and 2 sec paused in every video. experiment guideline is clear.
A3O7X46E3REM7I: It makes the viewing experience annoying. Everything was clear.
A3P2WQO8VESWF2: In the basket ball match videos shown in the clips, the quality of damages of video pause and decrease in resolution occuring at the most crucial points of the match particularly when attempting to put the ball into the basket, are the most annoying viewing experience. When both video pause and decrease in resolution occurs it is most annoying. The experiment guide lines as well as grading instructions were quite clear and there was no confusion at all.
A1S34BUFNQ33SQ: I have noticed both blurs and pauses in all the videos. Couple of videos while passing the ball from one person to another it was completely blurred and paused which was quite disturbing the video
ASWZO1WY1UHEP: Attention check was clear and also instruction was clear. I can clearly find the damage or quality of the video. Video quality was very bad. I feel little bit disturbance to watch the video based on the quality. All videos, resolution was decreased and paused more than 1 second.
AVPD36WUJKJFS: Video getting pause for a second or resolution getting low will be irritating thing, mainly when we are watching some live sports; this experiment guideline is clear and not confused.
