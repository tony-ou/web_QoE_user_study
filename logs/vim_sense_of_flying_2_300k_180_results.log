#REASONING#
###########

A2H8GNSEVUJXYL: doesn't matter if it happens before he jumps. the subtitles are more annoying and distracting
A1UM7U8DA3RMA9: Watching videos with low resolution and pause issue will be annoying and disturbing. Experiment guidelines are clear.
A3UUH3632AI3ZX: no matter when it happened, it was very annoying because the video is cool and the disturbances were a lot
A1L8RL58MYU4NC: The Quality damages blur and slag annoyed me a lot no one will like this kind of annoying clips. The Guidelines for this experiment is very clear. Attention check and grading doesn't confused me
A3N5RTXKN4I723: resolution decrease and video pause for more than 1 second
A2BO8M77CS3SGZ: It was an exciting video. The quality damage in the video was frustrtaing. Had fun in working on this study.Instruction were clear. Looking forward to work more on these.Thank you
ASPRULQHB8B1F: The videos were lacking quality and fluidity, making the experience of watching them not pleasant
A31Z5TPD8QKE26: when he's standing at the top and the damage occurred, it wasn't as bad as when he was flying through the air.
A1IU5OP7BBZHZ7: got struck in between videos makes loose patience, Blurring for very few seconds makes no difference from the good one
A1F1BIPJR11LSR: If the quality degrades during a replay than it is not as disruptive as if it were doing actual gameplay.
A122E99M2DQY1G: resolution decrease and video pause
A1NOINYD1FZ55T: Not confusing. easy to grade all videos. all video clips are blurry and paused one second.
A30YUELTPFSF0T: Video Paused and Resolution decrease which damages the quality. It was considered as an Bad
A3169N2SCN3ENK: The quality makes me lose focus on what I am watching and it takes away from my concentration.  The experiment guideline is clear.  I am not confused about the grading.
A6DX45U3O1CR: found both resolution decrease and video pause for more than one second
A3B67I3A0YR2D:  found both bad resolution and video pause
AH22ILXQFI4R2: resolution decrease and video pause for more than 1 second.
A1NJ6Q940T7HEB: Found both resolution decrease and video pause
A3OLRWACCCCUTU: when the freeze and resolution issues happened were key; when he was about to take off or you could see him in entirety it was worse than when it was just the back of him when it wasn't as noticable or dramatic.
A3UM3RQRAL4DP5: both video pausing and video resolution decrease
A3QZMGTVA4VO44: Quality damage in the beginning of the video didn't make any impact on my observation. But towards the middle especially after flying make significant changes in my observation and it creates little bit frustration. Guidelines are clear and perfect. There is no confusion in grading and attention checks.
A1NH9LK567B862: Both pause and resolution issues damaged the quality of the video more. No confusion about the grading so far. 
A18LFH7XW61JO9: When the man was going to jump, quality damage and pause at that time was very crucial.
A2YHSU2IJZ9J14: More video examples will be helpful.
A2QD9PJUKW7PKK: i had given rating based on the video image position and when does it goes low resolution, some low resolution video looks fair, some looks poor and some looks bad, so based on that i had given rating and there is also 2 sec paused in video. experiment guideline is clear
A2MCG5W6LHSRG9: Right before the countdown was about to go off and he jumped was the worst time for an issue. Long static shots were the best or the very start of the video.
A3N5P5VO81FIJ6: pausing the video some times
A3P2WQO8VESWF2: Quality damage due to video pause and decrease in resolution in respect of these videos, creates more annoyance when they occur at the begining part of the video. When the person attempts to jump and actually jumps, at that moment , if quality damage occurs then it is truely annoying. Others are tolerable. Experiment guidelines and attention checks are clear.
ARTQWWNFA7IOD: Observed the Quality Damages due to resolution decrease and video pause more than 1 second
A1S34BUFNQ33SQ: I found all the video's blur and pauses, But this pause or blurs doesn't effect the performance of video and viewing experience 
A11SX02CICZN85: It just affect my eagerness to watch the clip. The guidelines for this HIT is very clear as always. I haven't confused in grading
A4T7PYGN1BE2P: it is anoying when the video quality decreased and paused.
ASWZO1WY1UHEP: I can't confuse attention checks and instruction was clear. I can clearly find the damage or quality of the video. Video quality was poor. All videos resolution was decreased and paused more than 1 second.
