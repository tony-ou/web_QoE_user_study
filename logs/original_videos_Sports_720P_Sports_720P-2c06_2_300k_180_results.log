#REASONING#
###########

A2H8GNSEVUJXYL: this is a retake of url http://ec2-35-166-31-164.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3009/
A1UM7U8DA3RMA9: Watching videos with frequent low resolution and pause issue will be annoying and disturbing thing  . Experiment guidelines are clear.
A3UUH3632AI3ZX: was pretty annoying unless it happened at the end
A8FUMDQFBKMXR: The quality changes aren't bad when they are at less exciting times
A1L8RL58MYU4NC: The Quality damages blur and slag annoyed me a lot no one will like this kind of annoying clips. The Guidelines for this experiment is very clear. Attention check and grading doesn't confused me
A3N5RTXKN4I723: resolution decrease and video pause for more than 1 second
A2BO8M77CS3SGZ: Poor quality at important times are very annoying to watch. However if the quality is poor at times when the game is not in play then its fine. The guidelines for the study is pretty clear.
A31Z5TPD8QKE26: When it was blurry and stalled during a moment that was not important, I didn't mind the damage as much.
A1IU5OP7BBZHZ7: got struck in between videos makes loose patience, Blurring for very few seconds makes no difference from the good one
A122E99M2DQY1G: resolution decrease and video pause
A3PGUPNMOU5BPW: These videos are kind of bad quality. The annoyance is there most of the time. 
A3169N2SCN3ENK: The quality makes me lose focus on what I am watching and it takes away from my concentration.  The experiment guideline is clear.  I am not confused about the grading.
A6DX45U3O1CR: found both resolution decrease and video pause for more than one second
AH22ILXQFI4R2: resolution decrease and video pause for more than 1 second.
A1MIR0TP081SKT: Pauses in between the videos especially on an intresting point of the game is more annoying.
A1NJ6Q940T7HEB: Found both resolution decrease and video pause
A272A0JGRTBFCR: Thanks for your â€‹OUTSTANDING HITS and i would thank you for giving me the chance to participate and you are helping make me better.
A3OLRWACCCCUTU: the worst was the last where it was blurry and stopped as he was about to throw; when the issues were before he started to move, or after the object landed it wasn't as impactful
A1P3Z24Y6GRNVA: The pausing and screen resolution really effects the experience no matter what area it appears. 
A3UM3RQRAL4DP5: both video pausing and video resolution decrease
A1NH9LK567B862: The video quality damaged at each and every video. It just blurred and paused for a second. The experiment guide is so clear which helps in grading the videos without any confusions.
A1IHI23KH87K5W: The blur is very very subtle so not at all annoying really
A2YHSU2IJZ9J14: More video examples will be helpful.
A2QD9PJUKW7PKK: some of the video the resolution was low but not too low so i had given poor rating. Some videos resolution was little low so i had given fairly rating.there was 2 sec pause in every test video
A3P2WQO8VESWF2: Quality damage at different moments affect viewing experience negatively. But the quality damages encountered at crucial points of a video is most annoying. For example in the video the quality damages encountered at the early stage before throwing the disc and at the last moments after the disc launched is not as annoying as that which occurs in between. The experiment guidelines are clear and so are the attention checks.
A1S34BUFNQ33SQ: I found pauses and blurs in all the videos. But I think in one video the pause occurs right before the player is going to shoot ball which makes more annoying than the other videos. And in another video, the pause happens at moment with very few actions so it's not so annoying
A11SX02CICZN85: It just affect my eagerness to watch the clip. The guidelines for this HIT is very clear as always. I haven't confused in grading
A3QS7M912JGKFD: video paused and resolution got decreased, guideline is very clear
A4T7PYGN1BE2P: The Guideline are clear and it is annoying when video get paused and quality decreased.
ASWZO1WY1UHEP: Attention checks was clear and instruction was understandable. I can clearly find the damage or quality of the video. Video quality was very bad. Sometimes little bit irritating to watch the video, because of the quality. All videos, resolution was decreased and paused more than 1 second.
AVPD36WUJKJFS: Video getting pause or low resolution will be irritating, and I use to get breaking/throwing things near to me when watching online live streaming of sports; this experiment guideline is clear and not confused about the grading or the attention check. Thank You.
