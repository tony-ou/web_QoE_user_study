#REASONING#
###########

A1T79J0XQXDDGC: The quality in these videos were fine, easily able to watch and follow along.
A320BT7PLIQVZT: Durung the action times it was more annoying. and when the resolution dropped quality after the pause.
A2H8GNSEVUJXYL: easy to resume involvement after degradation with a video game
A3PYEW6693PCHT: The random pauses are annoying, especially during a game. It interrupts the flow of the game. Guidelines are very clear and I was not confused about anything.
A3SKQPPOKCZU88: Video resolution and pausing of video is less compared to other videos. But still, irritating to eyes.
A8FUMDQFBKMXR: I'd rather have the pauses to buffer than the decrease in video quality
A3N5RTXKN4I723: resolution decrease and video pause for more than 1 second
ASPRULQHB8B1F: When watching a game stream we always want to see the game like it really is, full resolution and no pauses. When the video lacks quality, we can't know for sure how the game really runs
A31Z5TPD8QKE26: the time when it stalled on a black screen was by far the worst one.
A1IU5OP7BBZHZ7: got struck in between videos makes loose patience, Blurring for very few seconds makes no difference from the good one
A122E99M2DQY1G: resolution decrease and video pause
A3PGUPNMOU5BPW: It seemed okay. This one was different because the one pause had a loading screen. These were not too annoying.
A2J237J8KM3OCS: its a matter of action going with timestamps, sometime its annoying and sometime its enhance of your viewing experience 
A30YUELTPFSF0T: Tank Video was affect by Resolution and it was also paused. In one timing, it was black and pause
A3169N2SCN3ENK: The quality makes me lose focus on what I am watching and it takes away from my concentration.  The experiment guideline is clear.  I am not confused about the grading.
A6DX45U3O1CR: found both resolution decrease and video pause for more than one second
A3B67I3A0YR2D: found both bad resolution and video pause
A3UM3RQRAL4DP5: both video pausing and video resolution decrease
A1NH9LK567B862: The video quality damaged at each and every video. It just blurred and paused for a second. The experiment guide is so clear which helps in grading the videos without any confusions.
A18LFH7XW61JO9: Important fight moments were crucial. Excellent interface and no issues and bugs faced.
A3G5IPGLH1IIZN: Going to a black screen is much more alarming than just a pause.
A1IHI23KH87K5W: The combination of pausing and blurring can get a bit annoying
A2YHSU2IJZ9J14: More grading examples will be helpful.
A2QD9PJUKW7PKK: ranking i had given based on the video resolution. in every last 5 videos the resolution decrease not much but can identify that image resolution is decrease. So based on that i had given fair rating as every decrease resolution video looks same so that's why given fair rating 
A3P2WQO8VESWF2: Quality damages of both resolution decrease and video pause are encountered in these clips. While playing a game these sorts of quality damages adversely affect the watching experience irrespective of the moment they occur. Particuarly during aiming using tank if such quality damage occurs, it will be annoying. The experiment guidelines and attention checks are not confusing at all.
ARTQWWNFA7IOD: Observed the Quality Damages due to video pause more than 1 second.
A1S34BUFNQ33SQ: I found pauses and blurs in all the videos, But those blurs also very minimal, Also it would not impact on my view, Overall the videos are good to watch and some pauses, except that no other issues 
A124E03UMDZAA9: It makes it so that I cannot watch the videos due to the loss of quality.  
A1USDMJVT10CE4: if the resolution or pausing occurs during moments of action.
A11SX02CICZN85: It just affect my eagerness to watch the clip. The guidelines for this HIT is very clear as always. I haven't confused in grading
A4T7PYGN1BE2P: Guideline is clear and annoying when video get paused and quality decreased.
A1Y25W1Y7KDE5: It's very annoying when the video stops for more than a second on a black screen, and that affects my watching experience severely. I don't mind the screen distortion as much, because the video keeps playing and I don't miss anything important. The instructions are clear.
ASWZO1WY1UHEP: Attention check was clear and also instruction was clear. I can clearly find the damage or quality of the video. Video quality was poor. All videos, resolution was decreased and paused more than 1 second.  Overall I like this gaming video.
AVPD36WUJKJFS: Video getting pause or low resolution  will be irritating thing, This experiment guideline is clear and not confused about the grading or the attention check. Thank You
