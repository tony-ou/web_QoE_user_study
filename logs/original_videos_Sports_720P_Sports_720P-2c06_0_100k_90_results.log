#REASONING#
###########

A2H8GNSEVUJXYL: blurred at the end doesn't matter so much
AKX5RHHO8BIUX: If the quality damage is at the beginning of the video, I'm less likely to want to watch the whole video, and may click away.  A stop or bad problem midway through the video will upset me but I'll probably keep watching.  A blur or stop at the end isn't a big deal. 
A3UUH3632AI3ZX: was only slightly annoying unless it happened during the actual throw.
AM0JKZVOEOTMA: Decreasing video quality is not good to view the videos. Experiment guidelines are clear
AJZBAP861F6X1: Very interesting Survey. Video got Blur for a minute it affects the video watching experience.
A8FUMDQFBKMXR: qaulity decreases during the action is really annoying but at the end when they are scoring is not so bad.
A1L8RL58MYU4NC: The Quality damages blur me a lot no one will like this kind of annoying clips. The Guidelines for this experiment is very clear. Attention check and grading doesn't confused me
A3N5RTXKN4I723: resolution decrease
A2BO8M77CS3SGZ: Poor quality at important times are very annoying to watch. However if the quality is poor at times when the game is not in play then its fine. The guidelines for the study is pretty clear.
ASPRULQHB8B1F: When watching a sports event, we always want to have a clear view, wich is not the case here, since the resolution drops during important moments. Very upsetting
A31Z5TPD8QKE26: When it was blurry during a moment that was not important, I didn't mind the damage as much.
A1IU5OP7BBZHZ7: I cannot concentrate on the video when it got blurred 
A38NFX88VZDMJ3: If the pause was at a point that was not important it was better
A122E99M2DQY1G: Resolution decrease found in all videos
A3PGUPNMOU5BPW: The blur at the start or the end of this video is not very noticable because of the net and the text letters.
A1NOINYD1FZ55T: During the videos found blurry some seconds.
A30YUELTPFSF0T: Resolution is only issue and it was not paused.
A3169N2SCN3ENK: The quality makes me lose focus on what I am watching and it takes away from my concentration.  The experiment guideline is clear.  I am not confused about the grading.
A6DX45U3O1CR: resolution decrease
A3B67I3A0YR2D: Video resolution decrease
AH22ILXQFI4R2: resolution decrease
A272A0JGRTBFCR: Thanks for your ​OUTSTANDING HITS and i would thank you for giving me the chance to participate and you are helping make me better.
A3OLRWACCCCUTU: It was more annoying when the resolution issue occured while the person was throwing and/or the object hadn't landed yet.  After it landed or before he started wasn't as bad.
A1P3Z24Y6GRNVA: When a quality issue arises at the start of a video, it makes the video less enjoyable because you have nothing invested; however, if it happens at the middle or end, it makes it easier to deal with. 
A1N62PWMUOG2YY: If the impairment is near the beginning then it doesn't feel frustrating or affect the viewing experience. However, if it is towards the middle, then it feels frustrating, because that is where most of the action happens, which is when the frisbee is thrown and starts to land. It is annoying because if I enjoyed this sport, then I would want to be able to clearly watch where the frisbee has landed, not view a blurred video of it happening.
A3UM3RQRAL4DP5: resolution decrease
A1NH9LK567B862: The quality affects when it starts blurred. The guideline is so clear and there is no confusion while grading the video
A3G5IPGLH1IIZN: When the problems is at the very end, after the action, it's not as annoying.
A1IHI23KH87K5W: Quite a bit of blur so depends at what stage it happened as to whether annoying or not
A2YHSU2IJZ9J14: More grading examples will be helpful.
A2QD9PJUKW7PKK: video resolution was low in every video for 3 sec  and there is no paused in any video.
A3O7X46E3REM7I: It makes the viewing experience annoying. Everything was clear.
A3P2WQO8VESWF2: The videos shown have low resolution quality damage even though they does not have video pause. These low resolutions occuring at main interesting parts of the video are the most annoying. Others are tolerable. The ratings were given accordingly. The experiment guidelines were clear and so also the attention checks.
ARTQWWNFA7IOD: In test videos observed extra resolution decrease compared with excellent grade reference.
A1S34BUFNQ33SQ: I have noticed blurs in all the videos. But I think in couple of videos blurs occurs right before the player is going to shoot ball which makes more annoying than the other videos.Some videos the blurs occur at moment with very few actions so it's not that much harm
A11SX02CICZN85: It just affect my eagerness to watch the clip. The guidelines for this HIT is very clear as always. I haven't confused in grading
A4T7PYGN1BE2P: The Guideline are clear and it is annoying when video quality decreased.
ASWZO1WY1UHEP: Attention checks was clear and instruction was understandable. I can clearly find the damage or quality of the video. Video quality was very bad. All videos, resolution was decreased.
AVQGY7FCU80XP: When the visual quality decrease it reduces the enjoyment of the content and makes it hard to see details.
AVPD36WUJKJFS: Video getting pause or low resolution will be irritating, and I use to get breaking/throwing things near to me when watching online live streaming of sports; this experiment guideline is clear and not confused about the grading or the attention check. Thank You.
