#REASONING#
###########

AAIQLE701DI9U: None
A3RYI5HXC2MJLN: just the odd buffer ands stoppage of video is what i noticed.
AT4QUBMY4BXN7: Both videos got stuck around after the 10th second
A1B76WYZ47BQJ: None
A2LAMCJLVCRQ4T: The only difference I noticed was the long pause during the video. I felt like the first one had a much longer one but even the pause in the second video is unacceptable to me.
A6579YP5QRY5W: Longer buffering in 2nd video
A2INXY39KBM92F: One seemed more clear, but paused more often while the other wasn't as clear and only paused once.
A1ZZINLCZZYOH4: video freezing in the middle
A15VCKELIEEPJN: The first one was somewhat clearer in definition. 
a1p2rq166vsbt: Honestly, it buffered at the same exact place in both videos and no sound was present.   The first video buffered twice and the second video buffered once.  
AIK9IRPT4M848: The pause seemed longer in the second video. I assumed it was buffering but I now believe it was intended by you.
A1VZSFHTU51JP0: They both had this weird lag about 11 seconds in. The second one seemed to kind of freeze longer though which is why I rated it as I did. I have to assume the second video was uploaded using some excessively high quality level.
A272X64FOZFYLB: One had more buffering time than the other, but the actual quality of the videos seemed identical.
A4QDCBGN79832: none
A2YGOORS5N9RW8: they both had a lag interruption, but the 2nd video seemed to be a bit less
A9HQ3E0F2AGVO: none
A2JP9IKRHNLRPI: None
A16TP8YGKE1FJ5: it stopped both videos but the first stopped just for a moment. The second one stopped for a few seconds 
A25OSUXL5HQ85C: None
A1V2H0UF94ATWY: None
A5NE8TWS8ZV7B: The second one stalled for a long time.
A2OG8XRYJ56HS7: I did not notice a very significant difference. I noticed that there may have been some subtle differences in quality, but I am not very skilled at discerning such subtle differences, so I was unable to analyze those differences very specifically. -- However, I did notice a "dropout" (a temporary pause or delay) after the midpoint of playback of both videos; but the probable cause of such dropouts is that my computer is old and slow.
A2XQ3CFB5HT2ZQ: none both were jumpy and I would not have watched in that quality
ANWVVA7X40YT2: None
AJY5G987IRT25: One of the videos had a longer screen freeze than the other, more specifically the first one.
A3U6IA3JUSFZ2M: None
A20N1NK5X5S88F: the second video stuttered and stopped while playing and loading
AD14EQ9O9JKRI: None
A2ZWWHY6ZEXC6L: VERY LOW QUALITY
A10AY39RH8ZB7I: Second video is best i am like 
A258MR1IS96JEP: none
AF1MN25P3XFLG: The first one, the page jumped more than the second one. 
A2R89RXGEVG05I: The second one's sounds were off or something was a bit off...it was not smooth and felt weird.
A3QG3P9I7SVSNE: NONE
A2PZS0DYRLS59P: None
A369HDC6T90Q1H: It is some time video stop and play but quality level is good.
A2FDEBTHDRUHRK: NONE
AZBS0MVCBSCGY: It is very suspence video but some times video stopped but quality is good.
A3GK90X2QOFR53: None
AUYQ097EMATW1: noting
AMFN57BJVYPPE: None
