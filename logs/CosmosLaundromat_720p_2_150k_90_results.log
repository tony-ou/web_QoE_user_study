#REASONING#
###########

A2H8GNSEVUJXYL: doesn't matter if the bad resolution happens before the caterpillar appears
A1UM7U8DA3RMA9: Watching videos with low resolution and pause issue will be annoying and disturbing. Experiment guidelines are clear.
A3UUH3632AI3ZX: no matter what it was very annoying with how bad it was
A1L8RL58MYU4NC: The Quality damages blur and slag annoyed me a lot no one will like this kind of annoying clips. The Guidelines for this experiment is very clear. Attention check and grading doesn't confused me
A3N5RTXKN4I723: resolution decrease and video pause for more than 1 second
A2BO8M77CS3SGZ: Poor quality frames in animatation movies doesn't matter to me. The guidelines for the study are easy. The study is interesting.
ASPRULQHB8B1F: The resolution was decreasing a lot, so the image wasn't sharp as it should be, especially for an animated 3D movie
A31Z5TPD8QKE26: They were all bad, but part of the animation is naturally a little blurry so when the blurry damage matched that time, it didn't seem quite as bad as the other times.
A26UIS59SY4NM6: This was annoying because it was middle to end. Pauses are worse than pixelation. 
A1IU5OP7BBZHZ7: got struck in between videos makes loose patience, Blurring for very few seconds makes no difference from the good one
A3PGUPNMOU5BPW: These ones we're all fairly bad quality. The times that the pauses occured didn't matter too much. They all were pretty annoying in my opinion. Thank you!
A1NOINYD1FZ55T: During the videos found blurry and paused some seconds.Not confusing.I grade easy to all videos.
A30YUELTPFSF0T: Video Paused and Resolution decrease which damages the quality. It was considered as an Bad
A6DX45U3O1CR: found both resolution decrease and video pause for more than one second
AH22ILXQFI4R2: resolution decrease and video pause for more than 1 second.
A1NJ6Q940T7HEB: Found both resolution decrease and video pause
A272A0JGRTBFCR: Thanks for your â€‹OUTSTANDING HITS and i would thank you for giving me the chance to participate and you are helping make me better.
A3OLRWACCCCUTU: Except for when the resolution issue was at the very beginning where the scene was coming into focus anyway, it was impactful when there were resolution and freezing issues after the caterpillar was shown because the scene was supposed to be clarifying.
A3UM3RQRAL4DP5: both video pausing and video resolution decrease
A1NH9LK567B862: I get annoyed when the video got blurred and paused. It literally brings a bad experience. The guideline is very clear to understand. It helps me to grade the video without any issues
A1IHI23KH87K5W: Having both pause and picture degradation is never a good thing
A2QD9PJUKW7PKK: ranking i had given based on the video resolution and 2 sec paused in every video
A2MCG5W6LHSRG9: worst time was when the character was just waking up because something new and interesting was happening.
A3O7X46E3REM7I: It makes the viewing experience annoying. Everything was clear.
A3N5P5VO81FIJ6: a little
A3P2WQO8VESWF2: Quality damage in these clips are both video pause and decrease in resolution. The video clips are having very attractive and colorful scenes. Hence I feel that both these quality damages occuring at any part of the video will have adverse effect. The experiment guidelines, grading and attention checks are quite clear.
ARTQWWNFA7IOD: Observed the Quality Damages due to resolution decrease and video pause more than 1 second.
A11SX02CICZN85: It just affect my eagerness to watch the clip. The guidelines for this HIT is very clear as always. I haven't confused in grading
A3QS7M912JGKFD: video pause and resolution decreased
ASWZO1WY1UHEP: I can't confuse attention checks and instruction was understandable. I can clearly, find the damage or quality of the video. Video quality was very bad. All videos, resolution was decreased and paused more than 1 second.
AVPD36WUJKJFS: For these type animation videos should not have any low resolution or Pause issue, otherwise we will not enjoy the video. This experiment guideline is clear. Thank you.
