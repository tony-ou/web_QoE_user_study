#REASONING#
###########

A2H8GNSEVUJXYL: so much expression is conveyed in the face of an animated character that is the thing that must not be obscured
A1UM7U8DA3RMA9: Watching videos with low resolution and pause issue will be annoying and disturbing. Experiment guidelines are clear.
A1L8RL58MYU4NC: The Quality damage blur annoyed me a lot no one will like this kind of annoying clips. The Guidelines for this experiment is very clear. Attention check and grading doesn't confused me
A219VCQZADQ45W: BRIEF PAUSE, OR A LITTLE BLURRY CAN BE ANNOYING ESPECIALLY IF IT IS RIGHT BEFORE A GOAL OR JUMPING OFF A CLIFF
A3N5RTXKN4I723: resolution decrease
A2BO8M77CS3SGZ: Poor quality frames in animatation movies doesn't matter to me. The guidelines for the study are easy. The study is interesting.
A31Z5TPD8QKE26: when the blurry damage was during a section that was already normally blurry, I didn't think it was as bad as the other times.
A26UIS59SY4NM6: Some of the damage happened suddenly. This was jarring and annoying. Again, especially at the end of the video more than the beginning.
A1IU5OP7BBZHZ7: got struck in between videos makes loose patience, Blurring for very few seconds makes no difference from the good one
A38NFX88VZDMJ3: If the low quality was happening at important points
A122E99M2DQY1G: resolution decrease
A3PGUPNMOU5BPW: When the blur happens in the beginning of cosmos laundrymat it isn't super noticable. The rest were a little bit of an annoyance.
A1NOINYD1FZ55T: During the videos found blurry some seconds.Not confusing.I grade easy to all videos.
A30YUELTPFSF0T: Video Resolution Decreased and No Pause. it affects the Quality of Entertainment. Overall it is Poor.
A6DX45U3O1CR: resolution decrease
A3B67I3A0YR2D: Video resolution decrease
AH22ILXQFI4R2: resolution decrease
A1AZAC9CPBEP6K: The damages to the video didn't really affect me much since the quality stayed the same for most of it.The guidelines were easy to understand and I didn't have any issues with the attention checks.
A272A0JGRTBFCR: Thanks for your â€‹OUTSTANDING HITS and i would thank you for giving me the chance to participate and you are helping make me better.
A3OLRWACCCCUTU: The resolution issues while the red leaves are showing aren't as bad as when the caterpillars starts examining himself, as he is supposed to be gaining clarity.
A1N62PWMUOG2YY: When the video quality was bad, near the beginning, it was annoying and affected the overall quality of the video because I could not see the details of the landscape. In this video, the landscape is very detailed with rich reds, flying animals, bubbles, etc. so even a bit of blurriness really affects the quality. Blurriness when the bug was stretching his legs was mildly annoying, but not too much because in general, I could see what was going on and the blurriness did not detract from my viewing experience.
A3UM3RQRAL4DP5: resolution decrease
A1NH9LK567B862: The quality affects when it starts blurred. The guideline is so clear and there is no confusion while grading the video
A1IHI23KH87K5W: Not too bad, depends when blurring happens
A2YHSU2IJZ9J14: More grading examples will be helpful.
A2QD9PJUKW7PKK: video resolution was too low and i can't see properly the image in video so that's why given bad rating. there was no 2 sec paused in video.
A3O7X46E3REM7I: It makes the viewing experience annoying. Everything was clear.
A3P2WQO8VESWF2: The extent of annoyance in watching experience created by quality damage depends on when it occurs. In the video clips, in my opinion, those which occurs in  the early part of the video clip are tolerable than those occuring afterwards. Because in the video itself  viewing clarity is achieved in the later stages only. The experiment guidelines, grading and attention checks were simple.
ARTQWWNFA7IOD: Noticed extra resolution decreased when compared with excellent grade reference
A11SX02CICZN85: It just affect my eagerness to watch the clip. The guidelines for this HIT is very clear as always. I haven't confused in grading
AW2LIJBEY8QUE: The timing doesn't affect me very much. Quality degradation at any time is equally annoying. It's why I prefer downloads to streaming for animation. The guidelines were clear, although the attention check is a bit silly and could be confusing.
ASWZO1WY1UHEP: I can't confuse attention checks and instruction was understandable. I can clearly, find the damage or quality of the video. Video quality was poor. All videos resolution was decreased.
AVPD36WUJKJFS: For these type animation videos should not have any low resolution or Pause issue, otherwise we will not enjoy the video. This experiment guideline is clear. Thank you.
