#REASONING#
###########

A1UM7U8DA3RMA9: Watching videos with low resolution and pause issue will be annoying and disturbing. Experiment guidelines are clear.
A3UUH3632AI3ZX: even if it was just a slight pause, it was pretty annoying because the video is really cool
A1L8RL58MYU4NC: The Quality damage slag annoyed me a lot no one will like this kind of annoying clips. The Guidelines for this experiment is very clear. Attention check and grading doesn't confused me
A3N5RTXKN4I723: video pause for more than 1 second
A2BO8M77CS3SGZ: It was an exciting video. The quality damage in the video was frustrtaing. Had fun in working on this study.Instruction were clear. Looking forward to work more on these.Thank you
ASPRULQHB8B1F: When the video stutters it is really annoying, because we feel frustrated without knowing what's going on or what is gonna happen next.
A31Z5TPD8QKE26: when the video was mostly still, the stalling didn't seem too bad.  But when it was in the middle of a moving camera shot, it made it worse.
A1IU5OP7BBZHZ7: got struck in between videos makes loose patience, Blurring for very few seconds makes no difference from the good one
A1F1BIPJR11LSR: If the quality damage happenes during a low action time in the game it is not as impactful if it is at a high point.
A122E99M2DQY1G: Video pause more than 1 second
A3PGUPNMOU5BPW: These pauses were not very annoying. I thought they were okay. I understood everything fine as far as I know.
A1NOINYD1FZ55T: Not confusing. I grade easy to all videos.
A30YUELTPFSF0T: Video Paused and No Resolution Decrease. Overall it is Fair.
A3169N2SCN3ENK: The quality damage causes me to lose focus on the video and it is distracting.  The experiment guideline is clear.  I am not confused about grading or the attention check.
A6DX45U3O1CR: video pause for more than one second
A3B67I3A0YR2D: video pause for more than 1 second
AH22ILXQFI4R2: video pause for more than 1 second
A1NJ6Q940T7HEB: Video pause more than 1 second
A272A0JGRTBFCR: Thanks for your â€‹OUTSTANDING HITS and i would thank you for giving me the chance to participate and you are helping make me better.
A3OLRWACCCCUTU: When the freeze happened impacted the experience, but in this set not were as bad as they could have been.  If he wasn't in flight or it was the closeup that didn't show much of him it was not overly impactful compared to other parts of his flight freezing.
A1N62PWMUOG2YY: When the impairment happened in a few videos before the man jumped, I found the video pausing to be a very mild issue because the main action and purpose of the video had not yet occurred. However, when the video paused after the man had jumped, it was annoying to different degrees because it interrupted the experience and the video. It made me as a viewer feel like the experience was bad. It should have been in one fluid motion, but the pause really took away from the viewing experience.
A3UM3RQRAL4DP5: both video pausing and video resolution decrease
A3QZMGTVA4VO44: Quality damage before flying will not make any impact on my experience. But, after flying definitely make a huge impact on my experience. Guidelines are very clear and no confusion in grading.
A1NH9LK567B862: The quality affects when it starts stuck. The guideline is so clear and there is no confusion while grading the video
A1IHI23KH87K5W: Pausing during an adrenaline rush video just kind of kills it really
A2QD9PJUKW7PKK: video resolution was great just 2 sec video paused was there in every video
A3O7X46E3REM7I: It makes the viewing experience annoying. Everything was clear.
A3P2WQO8VESWF2: These video clips have quality damage which is perceptible but not affecting watching experience much. In these video clips the quality damage is of video pause only. It does not affect watching experience much and is tolerable. The video of flying was good to watch inspite of this quality damage. The experiment guidelines, grading and attention check were clear.
A1S34BUFNQ33SQ: I found all the video's pauses, But this pause doesn't effect the performance of video and viewing experience
A4T7PYGN1BE2P: it is slightly annoying when the video get paused.
ASWZO1WY1UHEP: I can't confuse attention checks and instruction was clear. I can clearly find the damage or quality of the video. All videos was paused more than 1 second.
AVPD36WUJKJFS: Video getting pause or low resolution will be irritating, missing a 1 second video on a thrilling moment will break my heart, The experiment guideline is clear and not confused about the grading or the attention check. Thank You.
