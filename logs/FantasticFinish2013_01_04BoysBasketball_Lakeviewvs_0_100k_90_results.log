#REASONING#
###########

A2H8GNSEVUJXYL: can't blur the picture at the moment of triumph
A1UM7U8DA3RMA9: Watching videos with low resolution and pause issue will be annoying and disturbing, that too at the time of playing some exciting moments on live sports videos.  Experiment guidelines are clear.
AJZBAP861F6X1: While watching sports video interestingly blur video makes very annoying.
A8FUMDQFBKMXR: Pauses and quality decrease during the most important part of the match are extremely annoying
A1L8RL58MYU4NC: The Quality damages blur and slag annoyed me a lot no one will like this kind of annoying clips. The Guidelines for this experiment is very clear. Attention check and grading doesn't confused me
A219VCQZADQ45W: BRIEF PAUSE, OR A LITTLE BLURRY CAN BE ANNOYING ESPECIALLY IF IT IS RIGHT BEFORE A GOAL OR JUMPING OFF A CLIFF
A3N5RTXKN4I723: resolution decrease
A2BO8M77CS3SGZ: Poor quality at important times are very annoying to watch. However if the quality is poor at times when the game is not in play then its fine. The guidelines for the study is pretty clear.
ASPRULQHB8B1F: The resolution was decreasing a lot, so the image wasn't sharp as it should be
A31Z5TPD8QKE26: The blurry damage was so bad that it was always very annoying.  The least irritating one was when the damage occurred after the game was over.
A1IU5OP7BBZHZ7:  got blurred in between makes us irritate
A122E99M2DQY1G: resolution decrease
A30YUELTPFSF0T: It was really a fantastic finish, However while watching the game, if resolution was affect, Create much impact than the Pause. 
A3169N2SCN3ENK: The quality makes me lose focus on what I am watching and it takes away from my concentration.  The experiment guideline is clear.  I am not confused about the grading.
A6DX45U3O1CR: resolution decrease
A3B67I3A0YR2D: Video resolution decrease
AH22ILXQFI4R2: resolution decrease
A272A0JGRTBFCR: Thanks for your â€‹OUTSTANDING HITS and i would thank you for giving me the chance to participate and you are helping make me better.
A3OLRWACCCCUTU: The bad resolution was really bad, and except for one instance happened when the players were moving the ball so really impacted the viewing experience negatively.
A3UM3RQRAL4DP5: resolution decrease
A1NH9LK567B862: The quality affects when it starts blurred. The guideline is so clear and there is no confusion while grading the video
A18LFH7XW61JO9: Quality damage when the player was attempting for goal was very annoying. Everything is very clear regarding experiment guidelines.
A1IHI23KH87K5W: Sustained, highly lossy blurs during sporting events are a total killer. I would change the channel rather than watch that :)
A2YHSU2IJZ9J14: More grading examples will be helpful.
A2QD9PJUKW7PKK: ranking i had given based on the video resolution. there is 3-5 sec low resolution in every video. experiment guideline is clear.
A2MCG5W6LHSRG9: The watching experience is worse when the damage takes place before the final shot of the game or during it. It wasn't as bad after or at the very start.
A3P2WQO8VESWF2: In these video clips the quality damage includes both video pause and decrease in resolution. The decrease in resolution which occurs at the crucial points of the game like when passing the ball by the players and during the attempt to put the ball into the basket and during actually throwing the ball to the basket are very annoying. The experiment guidelines and grading was not confusing.
AMX5R6NLYNA2K: When it's in the beginning or middle, it's more annoying then at the end. Guidelines were very clear I think
A1S34BUFNQ33SQ: All the videos blurred, But didn't identify any kind of pauses, But when we see the each videos, mostly very important portion it was blurred, i.e when passing the ball to other player or throwing the ball to basketball net we can notice these blurs 
A11SX02CICZN85: It just affect my eagerness to watch the clip. The guidelines for this HIT is very clear as always. I haven't confused in grading
ASWZO1WY1UHEP: Attention check was clear and also instruction was clear. I can clearly find the damage or quality of the video. Video quality was very bad. I feel little bit disturbance to watch the video based on the quality. All videos, resolution was decreased.
AVPD36WUJKJFS: Video getting pause for a second or resolution getting low will be irritating thing, mainly when we are watching some live sports; this experiment guideline is clear and not confused.
