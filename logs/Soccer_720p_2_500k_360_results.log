#REASONING#
###########

A3GLUDQZGEJL5G: The pausing isn't bad and I can still follow the action but the resolution decrease makes it so that I can barely even see who is on the field. 
A1UM7U8DA3RMA9: It is very much annoying when the online streaming video got blurry or struck in-between, And the guidelines are very clear. Thank You.
A2RK1FNF8QT7LA: If the resolution goes blurry during a key point in the game, that would be more annoying than if it happened when there's just text or something on the screen.
A2SKH7WZUEDGGI: no
A1Y0ABOUJUMCWW: I have no confution about grading or the attention check
AMKGMVI25PC0B: found both resolution and video pause
A8FUMDQFBKMXR: The lower in quality isn't that bad as long as it improves quickly but the buffering pauses are really annoying
A3N5RTXKN4I723: resolution decrease and video pause for more than 1 second
A2BO8M77CS3SGZ: Poor quality makes the watching experience annoying.
A31RS26HTX0W37: For the most part the videos were not too bad. A couple of them had bad spots that made viewing annoying. It was too blurry at that point. Several of the bad parts were near the end of the video. It was all pretty clear on the instructions, no problems with that. 
A1Y3VYHOYKZ1D7: Bad quality damage effects my watching experience every time but when the damage happens in an exciting time it  is worse. Everything is clear.
A26UIS59SY4NM6: It really depends on what the action is. If it is the broadcasters logo being displayed slightly before the corner then that is ok. I don't really want pauses right before the key moment. Pixilation is ok.
A1IU5OP7BBZHZ7: I cannot concentrate on the video when it got blurred 
A1F1BIPJR11LSR: It affects the experience more when it happens at points in the game that are important.
A122E99M2DQY1G: resolution decrease and video pause
A3PGUPNMOU5BPW: All of these videos seemed to have both of the glitches. It doesn't matter much when they happen. They are pretty poor quality. It was noticable.
A1NOINYD1FZ55T: During the videos found blurry and paused some seconds.Not confusing.I grade easy to all videos.
A30YUELTPFSF0T: I am confused with attention check question assigned for me. Task Videos watched was bad quality which has at the different timing.
A6DX45U3O1CR: found both resolution decrease and video pause for more than one second
A3B67I3A0YR2D: found both bad resolution and video pause
A2SJC9VRBGNC58: It depends on how long the damage lasts. If it's only for a second, it doesn't really bother me. If it's longer than a second, it diminishes my viewing pleasure. When the damage occurs doesn't really affect me though. 
A272A0JGRTBFCR: Thanks for your â€‹OUTSTANDING HITS and i would thank you for giving me the chance to participate and you are helping make me better.
A3OLRWACCCCUTU: Worse when the resolution and freezing issues are during action at the goal, not as impactful when the ball isn't moving.
A33CFLCMJNHHNC: It is always annoying in general for me but it's super annoying if it's at an exciting part of the video.  Like right before they take a shot is exciting.  Stalling or blurring when the players standing around is less annoying but still not good for me.  The guidelines were clear and I had no problems.
A3QZMGTVA4VO44: Some timestamps at the end time make my attention getting diverted. The guidelines are clear and nothing is confusing. Side-by-side comparison is highly helpful in grading. 
A1NH9LK567B862: The video quality damaged at each and every video. It just blurred and paused for a second. The experiment guide is so clear which helps in grading the videos without any confusions.
A18LFH7XW61JO9: Quality damage at the crucial time affect the viewing experience a lot. Like, when the match is intense and full attention is diverted to the match, quality decrease is annoying at that time. Grading and attention check is clear. Although pause is in every video but measuring that it is more than one second or not is difficult.
A2AO7QP5THYKQF: it was more annoying if resolution damage lasted longer and if it happened during important part of the video (such as: player is hitting goal). If video damage was only slightly below the excellent I was okay with it)
A2QD9PJUKW7PKK: when there is interesting moment and video paused it is frustrating and low resolution also frustrates. Based on my mood i had given ranking.
A3P2WQO8VESWF2: Quality damage definitely damages watching experience. Especially at times of crucial point of a match, if there is quality damage either by low resolution or pause, it creates a lot of frustration. In the videos which were shown the quality damage at the crucial points of the match, especially near the goal post were more frustrating than those at other junctures of the match. Actually when the excitement is at the highest point, when quality damage occurs, it is highly frustrating and disappointing. The experiment guide lines were clear and there was  no confusion regarding grading or attention check.
ARTQWWNFA7IOD: Observed the Quality Damages due to resolution decrease and video pause. 
A1S34BUFNQ33SQ: I could see all the video's blur and pauses, But couple of video's were not able to visible the football goal shots, which is really annoying to watch the videos
A4T7PYGN1BE2P: guideline is very clear it is very annoying when video paused
A320QA9HJFUOZO: If the damage happens at an important time it is worse. If it pauses before a big part of the action, it is worse. Everything was clear, mostly.
ASWZO1WY1UHEP: I think no doubt at all. When I watch the video, I clearly identify the grade of quality.
AVPD36WUJKJFS: While watching online video streaming, blurry & struck problem will be there due to several reasons, Which will make us irritating, for example if we watch a Soccer game and video getting blurry when the ball near to Net area and possibility for a goal. The HIT explanation is very clear and understandable.
