The quality damage at different times was very bad. I did not like it when the video clarity was bad at the beginning. Since all the videos had resolution clarity and were paused, they were all very bad to look at. The resolution usually became bad after the pause. The guideline is very clear. I am not confused about the grading or the attention check.
