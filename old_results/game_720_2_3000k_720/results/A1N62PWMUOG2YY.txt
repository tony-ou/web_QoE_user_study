When it comes to gaming, and specifically, a shooting and army killing type of game, every second matter. If there is any kind of blurring, like when the shooter was scoping in, it is annoying because you cannot see your target clearly. Also, any kind of pauses are also annoying because you could get attacked by the enemy and it creates a sense of frustration.
