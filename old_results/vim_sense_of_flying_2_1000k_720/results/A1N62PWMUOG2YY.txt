When the impairment happened in a few videos before the man jumped, I found the video pausing to be a very mild issue because the main action and purpose of the video had not yet occurred. However, when the video paused after the man had jumped, it was annoying to different degrees because it interrupted the experience and the video. It made me as a viewer feel like the experience was bad. It should have been in one fluid motion, but the pause really took away from the viewing experience.
