The extent of annoyance in watching experience created by quality damage depends on when it occurs. In the video clips, in my opinion, those which occurs in  the early part of the video clip are tolerable than those occuring afterwards. Because in the video itself  viewing clarity is achieved in the later stages only. The experiment guidelines, grading and attention checks were simple.
