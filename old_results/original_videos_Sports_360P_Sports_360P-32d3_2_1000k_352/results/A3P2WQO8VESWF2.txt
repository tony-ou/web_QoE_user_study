These video clips encounter damage due to video pause only. And these video pauses cause concern only at certain moments like when attempting to free throw and getting goal. At other moments the video pauses are quite acceptable. I personally feel that video pauses of one second is much more tolerable than decrease in resolution in the case of quality damages. The experiment was very interesting, the guidelines, grading and attention checks were clear cut. I would certainly like to do more of these type of hits.
