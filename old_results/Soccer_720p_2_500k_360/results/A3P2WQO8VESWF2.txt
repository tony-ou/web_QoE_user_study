Quality damage definitely damages watching experience. Especially at times of crucial point of a match, if there is quality damage either by low resolution or pause, it creates a lot of frustration. In the videos which were shown the quality damage at the crucial points of the match, especially near the goal post were more frustrating than those at other junctures of the match. Actually when the excitement is at the highest point, when quality damage occurs, it is highly frustrating and disappointing. The experiment guide lines were clear and there was  no confusion regarding grading or attention check.
