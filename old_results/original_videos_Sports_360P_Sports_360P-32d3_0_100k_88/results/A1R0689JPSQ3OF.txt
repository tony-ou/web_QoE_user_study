When there is degradation of the video during the action then it severely affects the enjoyment of the watching. bad quality at the beginning put you in a kind of bad mood but as long as the actual game play is decent then it isn't as annoying. But during the free throw or when the ball is in play is unacceptable and really hurts the watching experience. I was annoyed but not as much when the quality went down when it was only inbounding the ball or before the free throw but during the actual shot and dribbling up the court was very annoying.
